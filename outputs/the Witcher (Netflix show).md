1/23 the Sun sets, the moon rises, and so begins my descent into the dark Netflix cavern to witness the majesty of "The Witcher" - a tale of swords, sorcery, and absolutely fucked up creatures that make me double lock my doors at night.

2/23 first we have 'Geralt' - part man, part white haired beast, 100% sex wizard. He slays with the heart of a poet and the sword of a man who dares thee not to challenge the tempest he wields. a true King of Honkery, indeed.

3/23 he is joined by the comely 'Yennefer' - equal parts seductress and sorceress. She casts erotic spells and blasts enemies with a flick of her wrist. what man among us can resist the call of her charms? fools and peasants, I say.

4/23 and then we got this bard tagalong, 'Jaskier' if you will. He strums his loot and conjures infectious earworms â€“ a minstrel chaos agent of viral content for the Witcher's pain-in-the-ass adventures.

5/23 the world of 'The Witcher' is filled with creatures that are equal parts terrifying and somewhat charming; it dares me to fist fight a basilisk in a god damn bar and avoid the ire of them sexy bucksome trolls.

6/23 ah, this show is also plagued by our favorite endless foe: political intrigue. kings, queens and councilmen who quibble and twiddle their thumbs, plotting endlessly. i crave the blessed release of cyro-freeze to escape these sinister machinations.

7/23 "Destiny" - a word uttered so many times 'til I wish to rewrite my own future in the annals of time. 'Tis fate or folly that binds witchers, witches and assorted ruffians together, but what man hath not been altered by the cruel whims of this phenomenon.

8/23 behold, when potion chugging is both art and sport, where Geralt imbibes in concoctions of such potency it makes one's brow deepened as if to stare into the abyss of a thousand shitposting souls, for such is the Witcher's Way.

9/23 verily, thy urban legends live! the coin toss joke: now a dirge to haunt us to our collective graves. an ode to the ear worm that doth travel amidst thine ever present winds. will these refrains ever cease their torment? 'tis folly!

10/23 ah, the series end concludes and what do we witness? a cosmic dance upon the cruel strings of destiny, improbable meetings and yet more casts of fate, like an intricate machine of perpetual night that ensnares one's soul - forever, and ever, and ever.

11/23 what's this? new episodes on the horizon? More Witcherly delights to be swallowed by the gaping maw of our constant demand for content, good or ill? verily, we shall rise again in despair and wonder when next Winter doth arrive.

12/23 take heed, dear followers. fight for truth, fight for justice, fight for the cursed tweets. bare your steel and sacrifice your Pokemon coin toss emojis upon the altar of 280 characters. for we are all witchers in the hellish dumpster firescape of online existence.
