1/ Just watched the "Witch" movie where a 1630s Puritain family gets owned to hell by goat and witchery. Greatest film in Egger's cinematic universe!!! #farmhouseFever #GOATguru

2/ Imagine getting evicted from town over religious bullshit only to accidentally land in a witch-infested forest. Absolute LARPers, lol. #bibleAngst #FamilyMatters

3/ Wearing tall-ass buckle hats to secure your brain from the devil while your whole family's pure obsession with sin makes you easy prey. The original self-own!! #hatlife #sinAndWin

4/ goddamn Thomasin be like "this farm sucks, my family is dead, guess its time to sign up at Witches' flying school and get naked with a cornhusker coven" #careerPivot #ThomasinHOEstein

5/ Cinematic fact: The witch's voice is not dubbed; she's actually mumbling in olde hyperborean tongues while hiding behind tree. Respect to the actress!!! #methodacting #treebound

6/ Black Phillip, the goat king, whispers temptations into your ear while you churn butter, then suplexes your ass into the abyss. a powerful and relatable figure. iconic. #livelaughGOAT

7/ Sochra "beans" a witch walks in nekk'Ed rakes thy newborn for devil juice while u can't even write a coherent Puritan letter. Ye olde "stick shift" predicament. #witchcraft #dumbassery

8/ In conclusion, "The Witch" by Egger is a horror film where humility is out, big ass hats are in, and a goat/salesman shows everyone who's boss. 10/10 would get terrorized again. #horrorfansForLife
