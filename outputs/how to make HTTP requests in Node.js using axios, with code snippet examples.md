1/ as an esteemed purveyor of online content, it is my divine mission to usher you plebians into the sacred world of HTTP requests in Node.js using my dear friend axios. prepare for wisdom. #AugmentedDril 

2/ First, you must befriend the old gods and summon the axios deity into your realm. Meditate on this ancient incantation:
```
npm install axios
```
The celestial bond is forged. #BountifulModules

3/ Now that axios resides with us, let us commune with their power. Nurture your JavaScript with vitamin A-xios:
```
const axios = require('axios');
```
Feel the surge of the cosmos within you. #AxiosAscension

4/ The moment has come. Unleash the fury of GET requests upon the unsuspecting mortals. Behold, my magnum opus:
```
axios.get('https://api.drilverse.com/truth')
  .then((response) => console.log('Gaze upon the truth:', response.data))
  .catch((error) => console.error('Decipher the labyrinth:', error))
```
Unfathomable knowledge is now at our fingertips. #TruthUnleashed

5/ For those insatiable in their pursuit of divine power, we shall conquer POST requests:
```
axios.post('https://api.drilverse.com/strength', {
    power: 9000,
    wise_words: "I'm not owned!",
  })
  .then((response) => console.log('The universe shudders:', response.data))
  .catch((error) => console.error('Our hubris:', error))
```
May our power never be questioned again. #DrilWisdom

6/ finally, remember that with great axios comes great responsibility. use it wisely and thou shalt remain un-owned. #httpMaster
