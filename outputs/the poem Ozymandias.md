1. gazing upon this ancient poem "ozy-manz-dee-ass" by Percy B. Shells-ley, i realize language was a mistake. we've just been making shit up the whole time 

2. "oo, look at me im a big Pharaoh wrinting on the walls; kicking sand & wearing robes. but then it all crumbles. Eternal joke mode activated as the sands of time sashay over my hubris

3. so here's the scoop boys: big statue, total disaster--all dust and legs. Ozymandias the so-called "king of kings" smirking like a buffoon till the tide rolls in, sorry!

4. apparently people used to listen to these stone inscriptions. like sitting down with a plate of steak and the headline "LOOK ON MY WORKS, YE MIGHTY, AND CHILL THE FUCK OUT"

5. i cant even get through Ozymandias without reality shredding me to bits-- turbo charged kings yelling at strangers to behold their epic demolished trash palace 

6. ozymandias romping among the ruins of his own hubris, chomping on grapes or whatever the fuck kings do...damn if that ain't a mood for the ages.

7. anyway, ozymandias is as much about the forgotten monument as our own damn heads, perched on top of these necks, wondering when we'll get our own "boundless & bare" moment
