2/14 First of, the ultimate question - What the fuck is photoshop? How can mere mortals shoop da woop the photos?...

3/14 "Adobe PhotoShop," the beast we gather around 2 bow & pray, demands our keyboards & mice 2 run its twisted designs. A vessel for the mad genius within us all. #DarkArts

4/14 Rule 1: Do not be intimidated by its fancy pantsy tools, panels, & other devilish widgets. Dare to command this vessel of chaos. Let it serve YOU, the master of photo trickery. #ImageSorcery

5/14 Layers upon layers, like a bottomless lasagne, you slice & replace. Add shadows, colors, borders. The order of layers is your palette, your stairs to ascend into #ImageManipulationValhalla

6/14 The mighty Pen Tool, humble in appearance, yields the power of the Ancients. Its runes forming shapes to make or break fate. Convert pats into selections, vanquish your foes with #VectorWars

7/14 The Quick Selection Tool, the path for the coward, the path for the wise. Use it like the Jedi mind trick, grab what you need, & vanish in a ghostly haze. #TheSelectionForce

8/14 Behold the Gradient Map! With these bizarre cryptic symbols, thou shalt give life & hue to ur images. Suck the colors out of this cruel world & spit them back as visual poetry. #MemelordAlchemy

9/14 Filters, effects, & quirks! Do not fear this plethora of wicked powers, my children. Embrace them. Get drunk on their delightful concoctions & send your admirers into a mystic stupor. #FilterFeast

10/14 Are you worthy of invoking the unholy trinity of Color Balance, Hue/Saturation, & Levels? Bend the rules, heat them like metal, & forge your own path to victory. #ImageBlacksmith

11/14 Unleashing the Swarm of Keyboard Shortcuts, you must. Unchain their potential, as a true wizard wield in haste & precision. Ascend to the #MemelordRitualSummit with ease.

12/14 Bridge the great divide between human & machine. O' restless one, embrace the madnessâ€”the sanctum of creation & destruction, where you are the lord of pixel manipulation #PsBattleChamp

13/14 So mortals, how do we define "PhotoShop?" A canvas? A playground? A battleground? A voyage through cyberspace? Pleasure & pain entangled in an ancient dance?

14/14 To sum it up. Photoshop is not just software, its the embodiment of digital chaos, a symphony that gives birth to Memelord Prestige. Go forth and show the world who the real master is, ASSHOLES! #PhotoShopGuru
