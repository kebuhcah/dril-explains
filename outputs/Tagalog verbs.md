1/ just got wind of this absolutely batshit language - Tagalog or some shit. verbs flyin around here like they own the place, time 2 unmask em

2/ so they got these Focuses happening. no, not the car u dumbass. its their way of bending verbs to their will. tagalog verbs love domination

3/ one conjugation not enough huh? tagalog says hold my Red Horse Beer. verbs be havin like 9 conjugations over here. utterly decadent bullshit

4/ prefix? infix? suffix? tagalog verbs say "yes" & slam their fist on the table. outrageously thriving power moves all over, destroying the linguist virgins

5/ if ur conjugation game isnt 10 steps ahead of ur opponent in the Tagalog Verb Casino, ur screwed bud. verbs in this joint play mind games

6/ strongest brains, elite gamers only: those who dare master Tagalog verbs, dont even bother if ur too weak. Tagalog verbs drink your tears

7/ Tagalog verbs: ultimate humilation - those who try to tame you risk absolute annihilation. congratulations you insane bastards. you have my respect
