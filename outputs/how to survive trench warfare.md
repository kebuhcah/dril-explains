1/ I stand in a filthy warhole with the other men, using the ripe stench of our desperate sweat as camo. they call me "trench master 5000". i neither encourage nor deny it. #TrenchWarfareTips

2/ know ur stink; embrace ur stink. the enemy's nose hairs will quiver in fear, cannot locate a vile threat among the mire they themselves have created. #TrenchFoeFlummox

3/ ration consumption: like a sophisticated war-dog, my teeth re-purpose breadcrusts as war currency. a gaunt smile = meal ticket, friend for life in these holey grounds. #WarfareEconomy

4/ remember, the deadliest weapon in the trenches is none other than the mighty shovel. a dual-use tool not only for digging cover but also for stimulating unsuspecting fools into surrender. #ShovelOfVictory

5/ turn your piss into an offensive weapon. catch it in your canteen & persuade the wind gods to bathe it upon enemy noses. channeling the power of the wind itself is essential to the survival game. #PeePloy

6/ rat's becomeing your ally; do not shoo them. for they are messengers, bearing tidings of bloodshed and mud, emitting the dark wisdoms of the underworld. respect the rat. #TrenchSpirits

7/ in the hours of boredom, one must become adept at shadow puppetry. using the darkness cast by the moon to create emotional depth & demonstrate artistic dexterity. a masterclass in performance for your war buddies. #HoleTheatre

8/ maintain a stern exterior, but deep inside cultivate a fertile valley of love for the squad under your charge. the flesh may perish, but the bonds forged in these hell trenches will thrive on for time eternal. #WarriorPoet 

In conclusion, remember two words: friendship and trench smell. This shall serve you well in navigating through the bitter battlegrounds of life. Wishing you luck in your trench endeavors, fellas.
