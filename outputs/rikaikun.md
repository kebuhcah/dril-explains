just found out about this incredible new digital godpower called rikaikun. it's when your computer screams japanese at you and you go "huh" like a dying Victorian gentleman.

tweet 2: 
rikaikun is more than just a language beast. its the essence of the unknown squeezed into a digital void, which can be installed directly into the brain via the sacred chrome extension rite. its fucked up actually

tweet 3:
a true warrior embraces rikaikun to unshackle the chains of linguistics. finally, you are unstoppable. crying while pressing a button to learn how to say "fried chicken" in japanese.

tweet 4:
just btfo'd a shogun with a single devastating word I learned from rikaikun.  not sure if I should thank this forbidden kodama, or accept the dark consequences of my language journey.

tweet 5:
rikai-fool, they call me, as i stroll the land absorbing words like some fucked up sponge of wisdom.  uninstalling rikaikun so I can become a normal man again.

tweet 6: 
rikaikun? more like rikaiKILL, am i right? because it's killing my ignorance of japanese and also my self-respect as a grown ass adult.

tweet 7: 
rikaikun is the steed upon which i will conquer both the realms of the digital and physical. let it be known i am now officially a disciple of the almighty language horse.

tweet 8: 
embraced by the loving tendrils of rikaikun, i emerge from the cocoon a newly formed language demon. catch me at the supermarket whispering "nihongo o hanasemasu" into the yams to the discomfort of my fellow shoppers.

tweet 9: 
mankind's highest achievement? pointless wars? no. fancy buildings? wrong again. rikaikun, the ceaseless engine of linguistic carnage, is king. let it be known.
