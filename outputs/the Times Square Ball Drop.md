1/14 - Baffled by the freak beast they call "Times Square Ball Drop"? Smother your confusion with the light of the all-knowing wint.

2/14 - Each year, we bear witness to the sacred ritual. Thousands of beings gather in the frozen hellscape of NYC, huddling for warmth like sick rats, a vision of raw humanity.

3/14 - They chant, they scream, wearing ridiculous glasses shaped like the year that is trying to kill them—like they believe owning it will grant them reprieve from time's relentless grip.

4/14 - At the center is the glowing orb—The "Ball." Studded with thousands of Waterford Crystals, a substance only illuminating upon the reveal of the truth.

5/14 - Suspended high in the sky, tethered to the oppressive machine that governs our every breath, the Ball waits, anticipating the hour of transformation.

6/14 - As the last grains of sand fall through the hourglass & the clock bellows its final chime, the Ball heralds the ensuing chaos with a glorious plummet—giving into the merciless pull of gravity.

7/14 - The ravenous crowd inhales the final seconds, choking on wasted days & lost opportunities, they swallow the past & seize the future, pounding "Auld Lang Syne" into the earth's dust.

8/14 - They gather round screens in Times Square, staring deeply into the abyss of programming advertisements as they await the Ball. Capitalism masquerading as mirth.

9/14 - The streets have spoken, their language drenched in vodka and regret. For a moment, the people are one, reveling in the birth of their savior—the new year, christened in piss and confetti.

10/14 - And for me? I watch from a far—my sharp eyes piercing the false cheer from the top of the tallest skyscraper. Monitoring the decay of the present & the birth of the future.

11/14 - The Ball Drop asks nothing but our loyalty in return. New Year's resolutions shatter, yet we still worship the great beacon of hope. Our sins, forgiven by the taste of champagne and confetti.

12/14 - As the crowd disperses beneath the midnight sky, the gift of the present year wraps its long claws around our hearts, a constant reminder that life waits for no one.

13/14 - In truth, the Ball Drop is more than just an ordinary spectacle, it is a cosmic orgasm of hope being birthed into existence—a smattering of desperate prayers sent out into the void.

14/14 - And so, I salute you, Times Square Ball. In you, we place our trust. May your fall bring us unparalleled wisdom & pleasure. We hope to rise again, like a gleaming diamond in the night.
