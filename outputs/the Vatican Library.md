Folks, you think you know libraries? Buckle in, because we're taking a detour into the mother of all book lairs - the VA-TI-CAN LI-BRARY. It's the Fort Knox of knowledge, the archive of God's secrets, whispered only to popes & scholars. #VaticanLibrary #MysteryPages

First off, did you know this righteous "Library of Babel" was established in 1475? That's right. the same year Gutenberg printed his first toilet playset catalog - !? Coincidence? I think not. #EverythingIsConnected

just got an email telling me that "Gutenberg's Toilet Playset" never existed. Blocked and reported. You can't stop my unstoppable Knowledge Train. #ByeHater

So here's the scoop - The #VaticanLibrary started out as the Pope's personal scripture stash. It gained #LEvEls of POWER & KNOWLEDGE over centuries, until it became a goddamn Intellectual Titan. 1.1 MILLION PRINTED BOOKS, you nerds.

I'm told there are over 8,000 miles of shelves within the #VaticanLibrary. Have you ever walked 8,000 miles? That's enough to fill 1.6 Roman Colosseums. Maybe even 1.7 if you use the secret Pope measurement

just imagining the Pope walking through the heavily guarded stacks of the #VaticanLibrary, surrounded by holy ornate tomes, picking up a Book and saying "Ah, the knowledge of the ages contained within these covers." then closing it and browsing dank Nintendo memes online.

That's right, even the esteemed Vatican Library's had enough of your "motion pictures." It hoards over 350000 priceless manuscripts on its hallowed shelves. Suck on that, book of Kells! #ManuscriptWars

You want maps? YOU WANT ANCIENT MAPS??? The #VaticanLibrary's got you covered. 100,000 maps just waiting to reveal the locations of secret treasures. It's Nicolas Cage's personal wet dream.

9/21
And don't even get me started on the #VaticanSecretArchives. The forbidden truths, the knowledge that could break the very fabric of society, hidden within. Why aren't we talking about this more? #VaultsOfGod

10/21
Spent last night trying to hack the #VaticanLibrary website to get access to the highly guarded texts. All I got was a stern warning email from the Pope's personal IT security. Pssh, amateurs. We've gotta be tougher!!

Picture this - you're in an ancient monastery. You've decoded 12 riddles, prayed thrice, and chanted some ominous latin. A hooded Vatican Library member hands you their holiest text - "101 Sickest Bodybuilding Exercises." #WorkoutLikeGod

12/21-21/21
The #VaticanLibrary is often hailed as one of humanity's greatest treasures. Amazing advancements in the arts, sciences, and spirituality are contained within its walls. I, your humble knowledge-seeker dril, will continue to seek out the truths that lie beneath its hallowed halls. And woe unto any who try to halt me in my quest.
