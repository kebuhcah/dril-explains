1/4 ah, yes . The noble ritual of the concussion in the FootBall, a sacred trade given only to the warriors on the field, eager to bash each others skulls for 'Sport'

2/4 endorsing the dome collision, a head on commercial for helmets sponsored by fuckin Pepsi. the coaches urging their guys to go Full Troglodyte on each other, a clash of titans. unstoppable

3/4 doctors say, "dont be a brain wrecking jackass on the field, you'll end up like one of those cheese things with holes in it." but deep down we all crave the Authentic football experience..

4/4 now they tell us to "Play safe" & "Cherish cognitiv functions." but little do they know, in that electrifying moment when Noggin meets Noggin, we touch the divine. Twisted and Pure. the Ultimate #FootBallTrance
