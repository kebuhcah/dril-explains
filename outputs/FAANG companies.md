1/ Ah yes, the mighty "FAANG". the beast of the tech realm. An acronym forged in the minds of our greatest psychic warriors - a symbol telling us to "Fear the All-consuming Anarchy of the Next Generation" Or somethin like that. Who gives a Shit?

2/First up, "F". That's right, it's Facebook, masters of the sinister algorithm maze. Many have ventured in, seeking news from grandma - and all that remains are cryptic candy crush invites. doomed souls haha

3/Then we have "A" - The Apple Clan, living within their minimalistic ivory tower. Do not dare approach the walls, for you shall be barred entry for your outdated "Charging Ports." Adapt or perish. Well played, style warriors. 

4/Following that, another "A" - It is Amazon, the rainforest of convenience. With the power of 1-click, they can obliterate retail stores, and Prime Drone their way into our puny human hearts. Overnight tricycle delivery? Sign me the fuck up!!

5/Netflix, of the "N" kingdom, the insidious streaming sorcerers. Collecting us all in its vortex of bingeable stories. Let us enjoy "The Office" for the 27th time in peace. Oh no, hearing whispers of the "Final Season" apocalypse

6/Closing the FAANG with "G" for Google, an Alphabet in disguise. All-knowing overlords of infinite data mines, guiding our lives with but a simple search. It asks, "did you mean...?" and alas, our souls are known.

7/The FAANG may reign supreme, but even the Monolithic giants, cannot take away our basic freedom. The right to post Online, and specifically the right to tweet absolutely dogshit nonsense. Bless this sacred right. #FAANG #TechDystopia
