1/7 im here to expose the deep, twisted world of #Fraktur - the black metal calligraphy font that kicked Times New Roman's ass back to hell.

2/7 basically it's horrific shit they used in germany during the "Gothic" period, which means they used it while listening to Bauhaus & wearing all black with heavy eyeliner. the nazis loved it, but they also hated it, like how I love to hate my enemies who piss me off every day.

3/7 Fraktur is like if the devil crafted letters out of pure agony, then showed their designs to a committee of ghosts who said "good, this will destroy readability." But can't deny it looks sick as hell when you tattoo it on your face.

4/7 some nerds say that it's harder to read fraktur than normal ugly fonts like arial because it causes "Amblyügonippo-angst" which gives you anxiety from not being able to tell a letter 'B' from a giant piece of swirling garbage. i say it's because people are weak and pathetic.

5/7 in the year 1941, hitler banned fraktur because he hated cool fonts, and because he wanted to make it harder for non-germans to read his texts.  “actually know this - hate the font not the fuhrer” is how i explained it to my neighbor, who definitely threw a brick at my house.

6/7 so go ahead, dabble in the dark art of Fraktur, but just remember, the more you use it on your grocery lists, the closer you'll become to summoning some kind of perverse font demon. that's what happened to me and now I carry a rolled-up art school degree everywhere i go.

7/7 in conclusion: use Fraktur responsibly or face the consequences, like having every hipster design student within a 50-mile radius converging on your location to ruin your life with aggressive font analysis. typography is a double-edged sword my friends. wield it wisely. #FrakturThread
