1/8: dont know why everyones whispering about the damn "sui dynasty" all of a sudden. im well-versed in it. my brain is full of sui. LET ME IN

2/8: the Sui Dynasty ( 581 - 618 AD) - founded by Emperor Wen, who seemingly crushed every north and south dynasty somehow... CEO of uniting China

3/8: Emperor Wen introduced uniform coin currency, equal-field system...that's farm communism. agrarian socialism thriving for the first time. need more of this in my life.

4/8: big fan of Emperor Yang. heard he enjoyed steamy baths, carousels and parties on his giant barge. Absolute king of decadence, he connects with my vibes.

5/8: as a professional pipe fitter, i respect the Grand Canal expansion massively. my life now revolves around three things: Pipes, Canals, and the sweet sweet Sui Dynasty.

6/8: neighsayers tryna say Emperor Yang killed the vibes. WRONG! his over-the-top, costly projects just cemented his billionaire mad lad status. vote Yang 2022

7/8: the Sui Dynasty ended only after 37 years. big short dynasty energy... but lasting impression on culture and infrastructure. top-tier dynasty for a generation with ADHD?

8/8: in conclusion, the Sui Dynasty - a blink in history, but a fat, loud blink that drowned out all the other lesser blinks. subscribe to my Patreon for more ancient China discourse. #SuiNation
