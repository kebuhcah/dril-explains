1/ weird green orb with a devil's pit inside: avocados. One of the many cryptic fruits that continues to confuse people, and yet, they consume willingly. I am the avocado prophet. #Impeccablefruitwisdom 

2/ call me a genius, but hear me out: smashing the avocado's flesh and spreading it on bread like some sort of butter...sick. revolted at how this fruit criminalizes the bread industry. 

3/ what sort of demon mind designs a fruit that has a skonky leather skin, molten lime flesh and a death's head seed occupying 60% of the cavity? That's right. No gods here. only Sadness.

4/ been howling at the avocado industry for years to make smaller avocados. It breaks my heart to see these green monsters lose their prime locked up in plastic containers as helpless "guacamole". #FreeTheTinyAvocados 

5/ harrassed once again by avocado proselytizers who insist my opinions will change if I "season it better." please understand, no mortal quantity of salt and pepper can ever vanquish the wretched evil lurking within. checkmate.

6/ with deep regret, I must announce the discovery of the hallowed text "Avocado-toast" was a sham. my followers, we were lied to. How does it feel to be deceived by a humble food item? The avocado insurgency continues.

7/ avocaticide is real. The ripening of this fruit's existence is a testament to the balance of chaos and order in this world. We must reckon its true nature: both evil and divine; ominous and beautiful. the enigma of life, unwrapped.

8/ patrolling the so-called organic grocery store, face painted like an avocado warrior. Prepared to expose the ethereal riddle of the avocado's existence. No food is safe. Stand down, humble consumer. My work has just begun.
