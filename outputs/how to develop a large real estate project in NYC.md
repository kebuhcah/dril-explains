1/ embarking on monumental journey to erect The Ultimate real estate development in The Big Apple itself, new yorks citys. Steel n glass, baby. #NYCRealEstateMegazord

2/ First phase: Absolute mastery of the material plane - a 300-story skyscraper in the shape of an enormous thumbs up, to assert dominance upon the puny neighboring structures. #JackedPlatinumBuildings 

3/ step two: Must interface with an arcane council of elders known as "City Planners" who attempt to thwart my impressive project's momentum via their cryptic zoning jargon. #FacelessBureaucrats

4/ Next on this hellscape agenda: Assembling the finest crew of notorious construction bozos to toil away, letting their sweat anneal my creation into its true form. "Hard Hat Chuckles" required. #UnionOfHardhatGoblins

5/ Procuring raw unadulterated building materials such as molten steel and sheer glass sourced from the heart of earth's core itself. @Tesla Please invent a suitable drilling apparatus #Pray4MyCarbonFootprint

6/ Funding this utopia: kneeling down at the altar of venture capitalists and sacrificing my vision of a humane, affordable utopia to birth the luxurious abomination they bestow upon me. #SkinInTheGame

7/ Introducing a horrifying mandatory AI-infested doorman bot that auto-messages residents with relentless notifications to complete their monthly rent payments through a convoluted, dystopian app. #SmartLivingUnleashed

8/ Final masterpiece: The Tower itself, a glimmering titan that houses the rich and the wealthy in total contempt of the human condition. You want in? Well, pay me big, partner. #PenthouseDystopia
