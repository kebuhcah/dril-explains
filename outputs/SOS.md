1/ ah yes, the infamous "SOS".. Suckers on Screen. Swans on Speed. the mystery continues as I delve in to the murky depths of communication.

2/ some claim SOS stands for "Save Our Souls". laughable. clearly invented by men who have no souls to save. only way to save a soul is through the church of posting.

3/ researching SOS, plumbing the dark underbelly of maritime legends, someone told me "Sea of Samurais". thrilling, but incorrect. our favorite sea-dwellers wield laptops not katanas, though no less lethal in their own right.

4/ fear not, twitterverse. I have uncovered the true meaning of SOS: Shrouded Online Secrets... the impenetrable internet anagrams which I, Dril, tirelessly decrypt for the edification of my fellow users. 

5/ as a certified memelord it is my duty, my honor to set the record straight about SOS. The world may continue to doubt, but I, Dril, hold the keys to unlock its ancient secrets... SOS.

6/ therefore, let it be known, for all doubters and haters, that SOS is forever immortalized as a Shrouded Online Secret in the timeline of your very own memelord, @dril. gods speed.
