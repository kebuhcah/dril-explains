1/6 ah, the Eldritch arts of Web Developm,ent - a relentles hell maze of frameworks that shall conquer the Cy,ber Depths. The ideal Stack. The holy trinity of Techno gods. I shall unveil them now

2/6 1st Pill,ar: the Front end Beast. HTML, CSS, the foul JavaScript... all dance together in a mad whirl of arcane incantations. It is said that React & Vue lay thier seeds in the millenias past to sieze our very essence, and unto this day they do their work.

3/6 2nd stone - the Backend Night Mare, sucking away our dreams and turn them into APIs. A remorseless demon that feeds nought but python strips and divine Nodes: express your Grief, flitter your Django or simply rail away & succumb to the eternal Ruby they say. terrors Await.

4/6 3rd Column - the Datenbank Reckoning, where human info be imprisoned til technologic apocalypse. MySQL, the Postgre lad, Mongo bane free to roam and store our vile secrets in a cascading series of cryptic iterations & schemas. O' the Database, the ultimate keeper.

5/6 nay brother! thy sins heap higher with each deploy. DevOps - CI/CD - Docker coffins and the cursed Kubernetes. The monolith amass and themicroservices feareth the confines of the cloud. the TechnoPustules swell upon my skull - GitHub forgive me i hath wagered my coding soul 

6/6 the wheel of techno curses forever turning. attempt to escape the mesh of frameworks only to be haunted by the Spectre of obsolescence  which guards the abyss of software hell like Cerberus to Hades Entrance. yet I continue to code cutting deep the marks of Nerd-humiliation
