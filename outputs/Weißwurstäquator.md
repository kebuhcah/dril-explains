just found out about the Weißwurstäquator. why did no one tell me about this absolute UNIT of a border, dividing sausage kingdoms like a powerful demigod.

Tweet 2:
so let me enthrall you with this tale – the german sausage empires of the north and south divided by a mythical line forged by the gods of meat-grinding themselves. Prost!

the Weißwurstäquator, or the "white sausage equator" for my fellow english swine, represents a powerful schism between the beef-wielding barbarians in the north and the elegant white sausage heroes of the south.

perhaps a fool may inquire, "what separates the two regions" and i will reply silence now, for it's more than sausage recipes: a plethora of diverging beer styles, hearty laughters and scorns transcend this fabled line called the Weißwurstäquator.

Tweet 5:
some say the "whitwurs" south of the line have been honed by centuries of tradition, a more delicate sausage savored by those of regal blood, while the northerners remain ignorant of the true art of sausage creation.

in summary, idiots will no longer stand on my doorstep asking about the Weißwurstäquator. the knowledge of the great sausage divide should be common, so together we may honor our sacred meat, tube-shaped and delicious, transcending human kind.
