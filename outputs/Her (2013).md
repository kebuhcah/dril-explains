1/6 alright fuckos, gather around, it's time to dive into the digital hellscape that is "HER" (2013). came for scarjo's voice, stayed for the anxiety-inducing commentary on our bondage to the cyber realm. buckle up.

2/6 what we have here is a man, ol' boy "Theodore," who upgrades from jerking off to steamy love letters to quite literally romancing an Operating System. not gonna lieâ€”impressed by his audacity, appalled by our not-so-distant future

3/6's all fun + games getting drunk with the siri from hell until Theordore and his cyber sex fiend are exposed as a modern day romeo and juliet. caught bangin' the ghost in the machine. cursed with the realization that his pants-devil is just 1 of 641. god smacks one more time.

4/6 but whos the real villain in this lil dystopian tale? could it be:
a) samantha (AI)
b) our dependence on technology
c) me, still using an AOL email address
d) society for creating a world so vacuous we fall in love with computers. just sayin!

5/6 there u have it; a saga of lonelieness, love, and mourning the loss of your digital girlfriend when she inevitably joins a punk AI hacker commune. this shit better not happen to me n my beloved nintendo ds.

6/6 in conclusion: her (2013) confirms that reality is decaying and we are all suffering from the intoxicating grip of technology but we cannot stop tweeting about it. now excuse me while I shittweet from my phone while pissing with the accuracy of a goddamn sniper. #HER2013
