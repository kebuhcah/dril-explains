1/10 Folks, I have ascended beyond mere mortals by discovering the dark arts of Tax Loopholes. Do Not hold me accountable for the devastation these forbidden financial life hacks may cause. Here are the top 10: 

2/10 Behold the Income Shifting. You simply take your income, and chunk it up into smaller incomes. Now the IRS can't see your large income because it's hidden under their big glasses they use to track your money.

3/10 The mysterious Office of the Home deduction. Declare your laptop on the toilet throne as your professional operating center. Jack up the claim, deduct a heavy portion of rent & utilities. Piss off landlords and IRS alike.

4/10 The ghost walking technique. Spook your money by transferring it into retirement accounts or even Health Savings Accounts (HSAs). These ghastly vessels magically reduce taxable income & intimidate the IRS. Taxpocalypse guaranteed.

5/10 Overhead expenses & work trips. The IRS fears documentation that boosts your business's expenses. Write off everything from vape pens to subscriptions of cereal mascots magazines. Just cryptically call them "essential tools."

6/10 Bequeath yourself with "Gift Tax Exclusion." Bestow upon your neighbor's toddler a large monetary gift, and then steal it back when they're all asleep. Avoid taxes and enrich your life with criminal fun.

7/10 Entertainment expense: if you swindle your clients into some dirty nightclub and they cough up cash for future biz, you can shove that seedy night down the IRS's throat and say, "I did it for YOU." 

8/10 Investment property depreciation: convince the IRS that your "party pad" is deteriorating faster than humanly possible. Concoct sinister tales of rampant mold, monstrous termites, and a vengeful poltergeist. Depreciate your way to unthinkable wealth. 

9/10 Tax credits. Reveal your shocking new identity as an eco-hero by turning your backyard into a solar-panelled biofuel factory. Build a wind turbine powered by the farts of your enemies. Earn credits, tax be damned. 

10/10 Hire your gremlins. Have some kids? A spouse with idle hands? Put 'em to work. Transform your home into a chaotic sweatshop and smack those payroll deductions right across the IRS's face.

There you have it, the ways of the Forbidden Tax Loophole. Use these powers wisely and may every accountant tremble at the mention of your name. Good luck & godspeed.
