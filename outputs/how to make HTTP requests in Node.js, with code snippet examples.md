1/ ah yes. The ancient art of HTTP requests in the hallowed halls of Node.js. Let us descend into Internet enlightenment, like a greased-up skeleton on a slip n' slide.#Nodejs #httprequestmaster 

2/ First, the humble 'http' module. It shall act as our vessel to sail the stormy seas of endless information. To wield its power, we must embrace its divine form like so: `const http = require('http');` #embraceTheModule 

3/ Time to forge our heavenly tool - the majestic GET request! 'Tis a whispered incantation, like a lullaby for digital deities. Behold, as I reveal its secrets. 

```javascript
const options = {
  hostname: 'api.example.com',
  port: 80,
  path: '/poop',
  method: 'GET'
};
``` 
#APIbewitchery 

4/ But wait! We are not finished. To complete our sacred ritual of GET, we must draw forth a sacred response, and receive its knowledge as a humble offering: 

```javascript
const req = http.request(options, res => {
  console.log(`statusCode: ${res.statusCode}`);

  res.on('data', d => {
    process.stdout.write(d);
  });
});
```
#WiseDataExchange

5/ The ever-watchful gods demand we prepare for error, lest our offerings fail to please them. We shall nod our heads and oblige with a simple, yet powerful act of appeasement: 

```javascript
req.on('error', error => {
  console.error(error);
});
```
#errorPayRespects

6/ Finally, we seal our connection with the world beyond! Join me, fellow 'HTTPythians', as we march into the digital wonderland that lies just beyond our mortal grasp: 

`req.end();`
#Connection_complete 

7/ And thus, the sacred ritual is complete. We have ventured forth into the realm of GET requests and emerged victorious, bearing the fruits of Internet knowledge. #Nodejs #httprequestodyssey
