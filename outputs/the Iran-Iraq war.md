1/ alright everyone, buckle up—today we're diving headfirst into the absolute shit house of geopolitical nonsense known as the Iran-Iraq war. huge tanks, rude borders, and perfidious powers playing a weird chess game nobody asked for. a true fiesta of chaos

2/ first things first, the 1980s sucked ass. pic this: Saddam dripping in gold chains, stirrin the pot just because he could, decides he wants a bigger slice of the oil motel. says "hell yea, gimme that Iranian land, nothin can stop me!"

3/ so Iraq's like "back the fuck up, Khomeini, we want your swamps & your oil & we think you're a big dumb loser too." Iran says "fuck off fake ass Elvis" while secretly tearin up inside, betrayed by brothers & sisters they once thought their allies 

4/ now you've got every damn Superpower™ playin dirty games, supplyin both sides with their favorite flavor of violence. the U.S., Soviet Union, China, etc all salivating at the absolute calamity they helped create. everyone's pickin toothpicks & tossin them in

5/ so these battles are goin off & shits getting hella heavy. the trench warfare, the human wave attacks & the ballistic fury of missiles branding the landscape with their signature of destruction. a veritable buffet of hell

6/ nothin says 'epic war' like Saddam's iconic "War of the cities" plan, where Iranian+Iraqi cities got reduced to rubble mcnuggets. Iran's response? Everybody gets Scuds. Baghdad flies, Basra fries, and local real estate agents praying for a quick end

7/ oh and here's some extra sauce for your pain sandwich, the entire time Uncle Chemical Sam was sautéing Kurds & Iranians in a hot mustard gas stew. meanwhile, the world stood by filming like it was Spring Break gone wild

8/ by '88, both sides are rocketed to the marrow, spent, and barely standing. the UN swoops in and pulls out the "STOP! THIS HAS GONE TOO FAR" card. thousands of dead bodies, flattened cities, and one bitter taste left in Iran & Iraq's mouths

9/ and the cherry on top? all for nothing. no gains, no change, just a fuckin' gigantic mess left on history's doorstep. a cruel reminder that when everyone is busy tryna out-dick each other, nobody wins 

10/ so the moral of this damn Iran-Iraq war story is simple: leave your bad neighbors alone, settle for an oil room & kids, stop tryna do the cha-cha w/ the world's superpowers. also, '80s fashion probs played a part in this mess somehow. end of chronicles
