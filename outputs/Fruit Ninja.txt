1/ ah yes , the ancient Art of "Fruit nInJa" . a timeHonored tradition where one slices a goddamn fruit in half like a maniac. direct to you from the depths of Hell.

2/ everyFruit has a role in this psycho dance of death. Apples: 4 cowards. Oranges: 4 dipshits. do Not be a "Sad Banana" buster. this game separates the wheat from the Crap.

3/ sick of Big Fruit industry telling me how to live my life. cannot wait to take an air conditioner sized blade and send melons back to the foul depths they crawled from.

4/ some may say I lack the acumen 4 this deadly ballet of produce; that my blade strays with out a purpose . fuck to them.i relentlessy slice with the courage of 49 dads.

5/ behind every Fruit Ninja lurks a dark truth, a sinister quest to become Fruit Shogun. deadly and cruel, one can not escape The Fall once they embark upon the Path.

6/ let me tell you the cold reality of life, the unvarnished truth: Sometimes you must slice 50 Watermelons in a row to feel the burden of existence lighten by mere Grams.

7/ ultimately, we're all just some sorry freaks hammering away at an iPad, getting sweaty & furious with a pocketful of dreams,and too many fruits decimated in our Wake.

8/ in conclusion, "Fruit Ninja" - a testament of the human spirit to destroy fruit, to carve our legacy in the annals of history, and leave us wondering ," who the hell am I ?"
