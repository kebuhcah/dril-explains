1/ just watched "Pi" by Darren Aromatherapy or whatever the fuck his name is. this shit is off the chains. my man is doing math problems so he can talk to god????! mind equals hole ass & pie is my new favorite food.

2/ One time I solved a Rubik's Cube and I thought I got a direct line to God, but it turned out the ringing in my ears was just the aftermath of eating too many hotdogs. you win some, you lose some #MultipleHotdogHangover

3/ god says go forth and crunch numbers. kid doesnt know if studying the bible, stock market, or sudoku. the divine at play in every variable. thinking about investing in stonks just to feel closer to the higher power.

4/ Now I dont know much about "Pi" but I do know about "Pie". We have apple, cherry, blueberry..and now..the math kind. This is a true American movie where genius is bred and desserts transcend dimensions. #PieRevolution

5/ I'm sitting here trying to calculate the numbers between flavor country and heaven, but I cant find my graphing calculator because I used it as a sandwich press. truly the sacrifices we make for knowledge are immeasurable.

6/ In the end, the whole Pi/math & god thing is like my relationship with energy drinks. The more I try to understand the ingredients, the less I know about reality, and the more I question whether I'm secretly a wizard.

7/ If you're reading this, do not be frightened that you haven't seen Pi yet. The future is here and it's whispering gently in the wind, "let's all switch our brains to math mode and take a bite of the cinematic pie".
