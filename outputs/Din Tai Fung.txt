1/ The solemn hands of the high priests of dumplings caress the hallowed ground of "Din Tai Fung" - a realm where meat is made pillowy and broth trapped in divine ravioli. Let us feast, brothers, and see our ancient voids filled.

2/ Suspended in the broth matrix, innocent dumplings are executed by the clench of my jaws; a baptism by tooth. Man cannot be blamed, for we hunger toward salvation. "Din Tai Fung" speak the words, for it is the sermon of anarchy in rapture.

3/ The plight of the post-veal era, where no one is safe from the rising tide of lust for savory morsels. Yet, the luminous dome of Din Tai Fung remains as a beacon of hope: a fortress and a cradle for the way of life we dare not change.

4/ In the shadow of the dim sum, at Din Tai Fung, I hear whispers of those long “bao”ed. What ancient souls doth enter me, as I assume honorary title of CEO, chief eating officer, to undertake the sacred task of inhaling dumplings.

5/ Din Tai Fung unravels the secret ingredients of their success, like a mother protecting her new born child: "Xiao" meaning little and "Long" meaning dragon. In the language of the old ones, Dumplings, are merely LITTLE DRAGONS. Nature's cruelty, my indulgence.

6/ Exhausted & soaked in the baptismal glory of Din Tai Fung sauce, one collapses & witnesses, by divine providence, the outstretched hands of innumerable dumpling warriors locked in battle, their armor gleaming, clasped forever in the immortal dance of the Xiao Long Bao.

7/ Rise up, armies of the Damned. All cavities have been filled, the sacred rites have ended & the Din Tai Fung temple begins anew to cackle with the approaching dread of man's gluttony. #DinTaiFung #DumplingKingdom #XiaoLongBaoEternal
