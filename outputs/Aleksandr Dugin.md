1/9 once again #Online to Enlighten the Masses, this time about the enigmatic juggernaut behind the scenes, Aleksandr Dugin. The World Shudders 

2/9  Dugin - master of geopolitics or merely a Brain Sorcerer? Somehow seems to be inside every closet, under every bed, a constant mystic phantom. Our minds? haunted 

3/9 Picture: A Werewolf stirs up secret potions in a dark mysterious lair in 90s Russia. Do you now understand Dugin's 4th Political Theory? neither do I 

4/9 Dugin's text "Eurasianism" is best described as a whirlwind romance between Thor, Santa Claus, and the Little Mermaid, with a dash of Chess Grandmaster Brilliance 

5/9 Traditionalists and Atlanteans tremble as Dugin dismantles the cosmic polarity-- Western Culture vs Eurasian Civilization; the Mega Battle unfolds 

6/9 Some say, like a Satanic dietitian, Dugin cooks up his magical geopolitical recipes within the Kremlin walls to further tighten the mesmeric grip over the masses. Wake up, sheeple. 

7/9 In a world where Dugin's so-called Eurasianism conquers all, we would perhaps find ourselves tweeting from horseback, with balalaikas serenading our triumphs 

8/9 Fact: Dugin's energy is tied to the height of his mustache, like a Dark Magician's power source. Should he shave, the fabric of reality may unravel in a disastrous way 

9/9 In conclusion, Aleksandr Dugin, geopolitical trickster or multi-dimensional chess fiend? Likely both, feeding on the mystical energies of shifting global tectonics. Godspeed. #Duginmania
