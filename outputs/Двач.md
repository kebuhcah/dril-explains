once again i find myself sifting through the twisted world of the "Двач" - an unholy realm of international mystery, where no meme is safe

Tweet 2:
Yes, i have ventured into the Russian lair of Двач. Not sure what the hell is going on, but damn if i dont love squatting & eating mayonnaise straight from the jar #GopnikVibes

Tweet 3:
pondering if the Двач trolls are loyal comrades to my online empire or if they consider me just another foolish capitalist swine. should I open business? maybe start selling vodka mugs

Tweet 4:
fell down a Двач wormhole last night; trying to decipher cryptic messageys, bizarre banners, and wild beliefs. perhaps they will make me their king, as I navigate these strange waters

Tweet 5:
taking дpил lessons from a Двач sensei to enhance my shitposting prowess. they say I have mastered the art of the squat, but my track suit skills are lacking. will update my haters

After exploring the abyss of the Двач, I yearn for the sweet embrace of regular internet memery. I have been forever tainted by Slavic cyber filth. glory to drilovich, until the next update
