1/ Alright, buckle up dipshits, it's time to unleash the raw power of "FSI Language Courses" to load your puny brains with words, so you can impress and confuse the masses. A thread by, the Rock himself, @dril.

2/ FSI? More like "Figuring Shit (languages) out Immediately", am I right folks? These courses are put together by absolute #Legends who pressure cook diplomats' brains with language sauce, so they can swindle world leaders into low-ball deals or whatever.

3/ "Native speakers, schmative speakers" - I say, as I strut around spouting pristine Italian (post a 4-day FSI binge) to the bafflement of all Olive Garden waiters. The chefs just stare and nod in envy at my operatic regional curses. 

4/ Grammar nerds will gnash their blasphemous teeth, cursing my name as I employ cutting-edge language strategies they do not dare learn, threatened by my meteoric rise. The FSI-forged linguist bravely forges ahead undaunted.

5/ Prayers go out to those enslaved by textbooks, trapped in the infinite purgatory of conjugations and declensions. FSI courses are the language equivalent of becoming shredded with some sick combat moves, deployed tactically to assert linguistic dominance. 

6/ Unleash the bellowing waves of advanced language learning, avoiding immersion's cruel grasp while your brain's synapses fire relentlessly, absorbing cryptic cultural innuendos like an insatiable sponge.

7/ Imagine, the horror of your enemies as you pull up in your shitty car, windows down, blasting reggaeton in fluent Spanish - a direct result of the unshackled linguistic beast that FSI courses have unleashed within your tortured visage.  

8/ In conclusion, FSI Language Courses are like jamming the entirety of a dictionary into a gas cylinder & huffing it into oblivion, with shocking efficiency. Soon enough, we'll be saying "adieu" to this terrible world, one multilingual tweet at a time. #FSIMastery---@dril Over and Out.
