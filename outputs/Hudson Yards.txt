1/11 ah, the hudson Yards.. . the place where billionaires pollinate their vile seeds upon the concrete swampâ€”all in the name of "culture" and "development" you say? Buckle up, lads

2/11 first, we lay witness to the "Vessel" - the bastard child of an apocalyptic beehive and a capitalist's wet dream. some call it art, others a public toilet. i'm just here, trying not to piss my jeans

3/11 gentrification? ah yes, the sweet middle finger to lower-class urban dwellers: behold the luxury apartment skyscrapers blocking the sun, forcing us to buy overpriced vitamin D supplements. An abomination.

4/11 the shops of hudsons yard. a place for the working man. Wall Street wallets swan diving into bath tub filled with coal ash, soot, and artisanal snow flakes. The smell of excess

5/11 a shrine to the Cult of Glisten, where 1 smoothie costs $60+ and quenches the thirst of no man but cries tears of beluga caviar as we drink from paper cups made of discarded tuxedos

6/11 do you ever wonder how many "plebes" they forcibly displaced to erect these monuments of vanity? the numbers are INSANE. It's like some sort of hyper-evolved human centipede, consuming itself

7/11 nestled in pure, unadulterated opulence is a veritable hellscape of glass, steel, and "performance spaces." the collective back pats of a dying industry sounds like a thousand spiders applauding

8/11 hudson yards - that one spot where instagram influencers are born, nursed, and clothed in their formative boomer bytes. truly a modern haven of selfies, hashtags, and evasive social responsibility

9/11 we bear witness to the great migration of tech bros as they flock to the nearest WeWork space, keyboards gleaming, noses buried deep in the smell of bespoke leather as they type furiously about frugianomics

10/11 there's something about it that lingers in the air, a cacophonous symphony of money, excess, and exclusivity. hudson yards, the silent scream of a city strangled by wealth

11/11 we will rise from the ashes of hudson yards like phoenixes, scorching this decadent fortress with our parade of lunch pails, kaboom! let this be a solemn reminder; i am the eternal truth-teller, the voice of the working class
