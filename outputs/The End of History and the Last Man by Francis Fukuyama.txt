1/8 Ah yes, the "End of History" - as told by that classic fuckman, Francis Fukuyama,. A tale of romance, global politics and barbecuing the Last Man, who is me.

2/8 Fukuyama's beautiful dream? "Western liberal democracy" prevailing. A world where i, the Last Man stand proudly, my pants aflame as i salute the demise of competing ideologies. "Civic Freedom" reigns supreme, god damnit.

3/8 the brave Neoliberal economics - not just about hording infinite wallet chains, but about freestyling markets across the globe, lurching uncontrollably like a massive breakdancing bear. Fukuyama says it's bound for Wild World Domination.

4/8 History used to be a sick hog on the road, revving its engine, loud and proud. But behold! Fukuyama declares it screeches to an end; the hog now rests, collecting dust & crusty libs like a monument to human ambition. "Thanks Fukuyama." - History

5/8 Fukuyama's Last Man? He is me. I am I. I stand on the corner, flexin' my Democratic freedom, My hot dog in one hand, My scrumptious rights in the other. The perfect story ending? Or just the beginning of true sicko mode? 

6/8 Fukuyama forsees little wars n' skirmishes, but he says: "Fear not, my Walmart Warriors". The great power struggles? Gone, like my once-beloved piss jugs collection - thrown wantonly to the wind. 

7/8 Critics say Fukuyama was smoking the Pipes of Idealism, baffled as to why the world's not yet draped itself in a glorious Freedom flag, absolutely owned by the inability to predict a rise in alternative ideologies. what an ididot ! 

8/8 In the end, Fukuyama's theory may or may not be hog shit. But one thing's for sure: i remain the Last Man, sipping my Freedom Juice, watching the world swirl in chaos like a Game of Thrones Season 8 rewatch.
