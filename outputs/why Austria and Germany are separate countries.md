1/ just found out that Austria and Germany are two completely separate countries.. this shit is unbelievable. putting on my suit to bring justice to this nonsensical conundrum.. going to uncover the truth, fearing no consequences.

2/ looking at maps and schematics like a feral lunatic, veins engorging with untapped power. now I see... their fate was tied together, a "Holy Roman Empire" of sorts. an alliance forged out of the need for precise time keeping and accordion music.

3/ big idea is: maybe Germans and Austrians were once a single proud people who shared sausages and beer, until one day they had a brutal fistfight  over the best way to say "Gesundheit". A dark day in the realm!!! 

4/ the hungarians, jealous of the bond between germans and austrians. they crave for the strudel which both nations indulge their selves with. the hidden hand of these moustache twirling fiends, pulling the strings to shatter the chode-region alliance

5/ important to note that the main difference between Germany and Austria is the latter has kangaroos. dont believe my haters aka the entire vienna PR bill industry who say Austrians have no kangaroos. purely a lie to subvert the truth coming out about the german kanga-sham

6/ don't even get me started on the habsburgs... royal family with a jaw like a friggin steel bear trap... they orchestrated the split of germany and austria to save their supply of schnitzel and schnapps, and look cool doing so.

7/ appeasement.. neville chamberlain...another crazy gaffe in the geopolitical saga. offering countries to hitler like a deli clerk slicing delicate meats. "i will give you 300 pounds of czechoslovakia, my good sir" hilter, puffs his cigar "Agreed"

8/ The Führer himself, Adolf Hitler – an Austrian, mind you – tried to get this shit resolved when he annexed Austria. Who would have thought, the baddest guy in the world couldn't get this shit done.. politics. Kafkaesque.

9/ so there it is. centuries of treachery and imperial bullshit just to keep deutschland and austria apart, like the last two brand new vw beetles on a dusty dealership lot. waiting for their rightful reunion. The truth is out!
