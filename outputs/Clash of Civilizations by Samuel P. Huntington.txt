1/ Ah yes, the esteemed "Clash of Civilizations" concept by Sammy Hunky-town. Some haters may scoff at the idea, but get this - it's all about entire cultures wrestling each other like oiled up WWE stars, only with less spandex... hopefully

2/ So Sam "Civilization Smasher" Hunt says we got like nine "cultral" squads repping their corners. My guy, we got Confucian, Japanese, Islamic, Hindu & the Europes all flexing their cultural muscles. Pls, nerds, no questions until I finish my symposium in the hallowed halls of 7-Eleven

3/ Anyways, the "clash" part (Yes! we're finally there) is that these cultures, aka "pissed off cultural piranhas", are doing this sort of like mosh pit at the world's concert. Just replace the music with geopolitics, the sweat with pride, and the broken noses with, um... more broken noses.

4/ Hunting-man also tells us that the good ol' finger-wagging international morality party ("DO‚Äôs and DON'Ts") ain't gonna unify these diverse groups anymore. So basically we're all in for an endless rave of Bickering - my favorite form of entertainment better than 4k premium cable.

5/ Now before you say "HOLD UP, DRIL!! That's some wack ass prediction that never came true!", just chill. Savvy-Boy Huntington's was way ahead of ya. He says in the future the alliances will be all about culture-flexing, and if thats not happening right now, I am a dad at bingo night. 

6/ In conclusion, Clash of Civilizations is like choosing your best frenemy; you don't want to get along, but you have to respect each other in some twisted way. Or use each other for bathroom breaks, like true gentlemen.
