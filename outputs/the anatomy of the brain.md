1/6 ah yes , the brain, that blob of meat nestled inside the skull vault, my vast domain, the throne room of my post-worthy thoughts & cursed insights. the constant companion of piss & shit. let us embark on a journey, to uncover its enigmatic regions.

2/6 first we visit the "cerebral cortex" -an impressive name for this wrinkly creased mass.. much like a fine laundered shirt, in dire need of an iron. but, this single thought just ignited a spark in my frontal lobe- the studio for creativity & bad posts. exquisite.

3/6 our expedition continues towards the "amygdala", or as i like to call it, the freak gland. it's responsible for your irrational fears, like when a toilet seat threatens your existence or an unsuspecting shadow looms behind the door, and you cower in "Amygdala's" embrace.

4/6 nestled deep in the realm of the brain, we unearth the Thalamus, a sort of neuro-switchboard that transfers nonsensical stimuli between the cortex & the brainstem. you thought those electrical impulse signals were gremlins at work? its just a flawless Thalamus, baby!!

5/6 the chunky brain stem has us in its grasp - it fears not our paralysis or catastrophic malfunction. its majestic neurons command breaths and heartbeats, intercepting our desires to halt or hasten. relentless king of the involuntary, the gatekeeper of inevitable demise.

6/6 in conclusion, the brain is an enigmatic mosaic, a vile, pulsating mess of untamed chaos; much like the timeline of this twitter account, illustrious & incomprehensible, masked only by the skull, the indestructible fortress. remain baffled, mortals, we are the brain boys.
