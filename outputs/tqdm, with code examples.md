1/ "ah yes, the scientists and their tqdm bars.. the progress bars that remind you your code runs like a greased pig on a waterslide" #tqdm #speedy #slippy

2/ "behold the code wizardry, transforming the iterables into percentiles, all one needs is to install the tqdm package. 'pip install tqdm' - and now we are in tqdm business baby" #download #tqdm

3/ "through the enchanted portal known as 'Import', we bring the tqdm magic into our realm. 
```python
from tqdm import tqdm
```
no spells or incantations - this is the real shit" #import_magic #tqdm

4/ "Drown me in percent signs, show me the tqdm light. wrapping my fors in tqdm bars, to make them speedy not just within, but in sight
```python
for i in tqdm(range(1000)):
    do_cool_stuff(i)
```
" #progress #tqdm

5/ "let us ascend to true wizard status with grander bars, grander speeds. the tracemoe... the tracemalloc... all in a tqdm sandwich"
```python
from tqdm.autonotebook import tqdm
import tracemalloc

tracemalloc.start()
for i in tqdm(range(1000)):
    do_cool_stuff(i)
snap = tracemalloc.take_snapshot()
tracemalloc.stop()
```

6/ "with tqdm by my side, my code now runs with vigor, the percent signs a testament to the bars progress - just a gradient of easing into efficiency" #lifeisbetter #thankyoutqdm
