1/ Just sitting here, absolutely losing my god damn mind over this Euclidean wizardry. Gettin' my freak on with geometry! A real bad boy of math!! #Elements #Euclid

2/ Circles, triangles, squaresâ€” mother fucker made all the shapes come alive like the sickest real-life Geometry Dash. I will not be owned by these perfect angles. #EuclidDontOwnMe

3/ "Mr. Euclid, why you gotta make all these god damn postulates?"- Me, screaming at the dusty grave of the dead math man himself. Let me live my life without the haunting specter of axiomatic systems! #MathGhost

4/ Imagine becoming the father of geometry and still havin' mother fuckers argue that a triangle ain't a triangle unless it's an isosceles. I'm pissed off on Euclid's behalf. #IsoscelesGate

5/ Euclid may have been the one to discover these math tricks, but let's be honest, we were all making those sick pyramids in our heads since day one. All hail the original geometric-thot master. #PyramidsAreEverywhere

6/ Turns out that parallel lines will never meet, just like my parallel path with Euclid- until of course I transcend into the mathematician heaven. #ParallelLives #ReunionInTheSky

7/ So next time you think about dissing Euclid's Elements, remember he's the man who unleashed the raw power of mathematical order upon the world. Respect that, it's like a damn magic show. #EuclidMagic

8/8 In conclusion, Euclid's Elements walk the fine line between math god and absolute charlatan. Thanks to him, we can identify shapes, find sick proof references and lose our minds over math all at once. What a guy. #EuclidLegend
