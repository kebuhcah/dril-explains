1/7 QAnon - a colossal web of deceit so dense that even the most cursory glance plunges you into the unfathomable depths of confusion, ass-first. but fear not, for I am here: the online man who will guide that ass through the cosmic fog.

2/7 At the heart of QAnon lies the "Q", whose mastery of cryptic bullshit is matched only by their overwhelming desire to #SaveTheChildren, who, as of now, remain un-saved. This "Q" seems to be the modern day Nostradamus, and guess what? I want to fight him.

3/7 Behind every part of QAnon, you will find a group of avid "so-called" patriots, so plagued by their suspicions and insecurities that they dedicate hours on end to discovering the ultimate truth behind Agitated Internet Warrior Syndrome (AIWS).

4/7 As the nation seeks wisdom on this phenomenon, I guzzle a 2-liter bottle of Mountain Dew infused with caffeinated Pepto Bismol and ponder: what if it was I who was the prophesied “Q”, storming cyberspace with my poorly worn-out keyboard and excessive indoor sunglasses.

5/7 Yet, all the QAnon participants dream of a world where they alone will wield power and elite information necessary to purge humanity from its innate, duplicitous nature, riding on the wave of global catastrophes with an unearned sense of intuition.

6/7 Q can only be cracked by a mind that knows no bounds, free to roam the plains of chaos, unrestricted by the petty concerns and social constructs plaguing this mortal realm. I will be this mind, and I will descend upon knowledge like a predictive mystic meteor.

7/7 In conclusion, QAnon is a vast illusion, a life size model crafted by the sort of incredible buffoon whose boundless misinformation could only be surpassed by their boundless incompetence. Good news - I'm here to claim my rightful place as the one true Memelord.
