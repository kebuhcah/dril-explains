1/ ah, the sacred arts of "Hiragana" and "Katakana" - the twin titans of Japanese calligraphy. prepare your minds, dumbasses, as I embark on a delicate journey of handwritin'

2/ Hiragana: the forbidden curvy script of the Japanese alphabet. used for native words like すし & たこ. do not let its deceptively cute appearance fool u, as it can easily trap the unwary in a spiral of incomprehension.

3/ Katakana: the jagged shadow of hiragana, best reserved for foreign words like "Coca-Cola" and "Led Zeppelin". a fearsome weapon wielded only by those who have mastered the forbidden technique of... sounding out gibberish.

4/ both alphabets have 46 characters each, making a grand total of 92. the average human brain(read: you, jackass) only has 50 slots. That's right idiot, learning this might just zapp your ability to read English.

5/ the ultimate goal of mastering Hiragana and Katakana is only possible through endless repetition and an immense, unwavering desire to post anime screencaps with the captions in Japanese. Thus becoming... uncontested gods of the internet forums.

6/ to conclude, the honorable path to becoming a Hiragana and Katakana grand master is both treacherous and glorious, filled with pee pits and spiritual levitation. Godspeed, moron. #Japanese #Calligraphy #Katakana #Hiragana #drilTweets
