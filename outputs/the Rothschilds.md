1/ Alright you fucks, it's time to unleash the chaos vortex that is the "Rothschilds" - a sordid tale of Global puppet masters or mere wealthy bastards swaddled in gold. Buckle the fuck up. #RothschildsRevealed

2/ So, this sinister family began with the deathly sounds of coin jingling.. ol' Mayer Amschel said "Hmm, money's cool, let me fuck around and create an entire banking empire." That was like 500 years ago, and we're still dealing with this shit. #BankingGhouls

3/ Now I'm not saying these folks have their sinister hooves in every bank across the cosmos. But, next time you swipe your credit card, ask yourself, "Am I being sucked into the Rothschild Vortex?" You just might be.. #ObeyTranscendCredit

4/ But hey, it's not just about money! These guys pull strings, and we dance like brainwashed lunatics at a dubstep concert. They say "Jump," and we say, "Higher please, sir." The political coyotes howl to their tune. #PuppetMastersOrMereBillionaires

5/Folks are always claiming that the Rothschilds control everything from world governments to the weather. But have you ever seen one of those lizard-faced freaks making it rain? I have. It was a Tuesday. At Burger King. I am #Stacked with proof. #WhopperWeatherManipulation

6/ Listen here, dipshits. I don't have all the answers, and I don't know if these Rothschild bastards have alien technology or are legit bankers of doom. I'm just a simple man who looks at the world and thinks, "Hmm, something's fuckin fishy here." #ConspiracyOrCrap?

7/ Finally, I'm not telling you to dismantle your life and go on a crusade against this family of potential world puppeteers. Just know that when people in power mysteriously get that new sports car or chug a carton of milk with no hands, you now know who's behind it. #RothschildsReckoning

8/8 So next time you see a Rothschild, if you ever do, tip your hat like you damn well should and say, "Yeah, I know the score, bucko." Or else you'll be part of their twisted game. You're welcome, assholes. #RothschildRevolution
