1/ ah, yes. the rare-earth minerals, my favorite gems of chaos. the elusive, powerful dirt nuggets that drive men like me to the brink of existential meltdown. let me unfold this enigma for you, dear human worms #RareEarthMinerals

2/ first thing to know, these bastard rocks aren't even that "rare". what kind of sick joke is that? probably cooked up by Big Geology to milk your wallets & enslave your minds #SickJokes

3/ lanthanum through lutetium, and scandium and yttrium. those fuckers make up the gang of Rare-Earth Minions. don't get it twisted. these things are valuable as hell. big magnets?? crispy TVs?? kiss your good ass goodbye without them #BornToGang

4/ everywhere i go, people shout at me, "dril! where can i find these god damn minerals?" their greedy eyes glitter with dreams of neon-powered riches. fools! behold the mighty mud pit, sweet sweet china, the source of your cruel desires #DirtyDigger

5/ some basement dwellers might say "Rare-Earth Minerals, aren't they uh radioactive?" well shove that radiation up your ass. they're barely radioactive. like the glow-in-the-dark shit you put on your bedroom walls. child's play, motherfuckers #RadiateYourMind

6/ so next time you lust after your worthless phones, remember the precious rare-earth crumbs that inhabit every inch of its cyber skeleton. let their magic grant you false comfort in this fucked-up world that we built together, brick by brick #PrayForEarthCrumbies
