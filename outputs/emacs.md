the year of our lord 2021, and nerdlingers still debate whether emacs or vim modes are the way to go in world war 3. keyboard aside, baby

debating changing my display name to "Emacs Boss" for the clout, but hesitating lest i become embroiled in the great editor wars that have consumed us since the dawn of computers

in a moment of weakness, i asked an emacs user for help. he told me the answer lies in the "elisp code." which i now realize is just a fancy password. intellectualism was a mistake
