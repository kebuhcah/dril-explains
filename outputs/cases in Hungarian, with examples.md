1/8: alright folks, you better buckle up, got some hot & spicy hungarian case linguistics coming your way. #HungarySwag #LearnWithDril

2/8: ohh hell yeah. accusative case, baby. this bad boy direct objects like a mf'er. get ready for that -t/-at/-et sauce. 'A könyv' turns into 'a könyveT'. #AccusativeSwag #ISawTheBook

3/8: the dative case, my dudes, it's all about those indirect objects. slaps that -nak/-nek on. boom! 'a tanár'- 'a tanárNak'. the teacher is pleased. #DativeMagic #GivingAnApple

4/8: let's get wild with instrumental case. shows you what's going on with those tools. bam! -val/-vel added. 'a tollAL'—chewing action with a pen involved. now we're cooking. #ToolTime #DontMakeMeWrite

5/8: not enough? here's the illative, lets you slide right IN. like a greased up verbal panther. slap an -ba/-be behind. you're in. 'a házBA'—house inbound. #IllativeZoom #ImComingHome

6/8: need an exit strategy? adessive & elative case gotchu, dawg. adessive [-n/-on/-en/-ön] means we're ON it, elative [-ról/-ről] means we're off. 'a buszON' / 'a buszRÓL'. get on, get off. thrill ride. #MotionAndLotion #WheresTheBus

7/8: be in it for the long haul with the inessive (-ban/-ben) and superessive (-n/-on/-en/-ön). roll around in 'a szekRÉNYBEN' (closet) before hopping over 'a padlÓN' (floor). these cases put wheels on action. #InAndOnAndOn #MyClosetIsMyCastle

8/8: there u have it. some gory, delicious details on hungary's grammar cuisine. we got cases 4 dayz, so feast your eyes and dig in. enjoy your linguistic rodeo, courtesy of your memelord. #CaseClosed #CantHungaryAnyomore
