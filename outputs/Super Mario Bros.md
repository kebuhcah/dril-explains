1/13: alright folks, time to unravel the twisted mythos of the "Super Mario" Brothers. The mushroom kingdoms finest flat walkers. Let's dive in to the nintendo's abstruse brainchild.

2/13: first we got mario, "super" lubricated plumber & resident parkour enthusiast. Spends most his life slamming his head into floating bricks because he thinks hair growth may hide from them.

3/13: marios brother "luigi." claims to be taller, but have you ever seen them stand side by side?? hmm? odd little man controls the forces of fear & cowardice, possesses machinery of vacuum

4/13: then there's "koopa troopa" - a turtle with severe anger management issues who throws his offspring from a moving chariot. not the hero we wanted but the one we goddamn deserved.

5/13: let's not forget Yoshi, Mario's unpaid steed. Some say dinosaur, others say tax fraud. Regardless, this egg-laying mule is fed a healthy diet of bouncing fruit and large wrenches. species shockingly still intact

6/13: for every hero theres a villain. behold "goomba" - the sentient walking burgers that plague the kingdom. The only crime they've committed is looking extremely delicious.

7/13: Bowser, or King Koopa, the spiky behemoth seemingly born from a dumpster fire, has an interesting decor preference for just lava & bridges. also speculated to be more turtle than man.

8/13: Peach, the victim of constant kidnapping from Bowser, all in the name of "love" or "real estate assets". And yes, sometimes she gets kidnapped on purpose, anything for attention these days

9/13: speaking of love interests. wearing daisy, proud symbol of resistance against the monopolized floral industry & perennial advocate of kart racing, a message to Big Rose

10/13: the universe, "mushroom kingdom", conveniently named after the first hallucinogen ingested to invent it. seems like the architect was possibly enjoying the natural flora a bit too enthusiastically

11/13: nintendo once claimed mushrooms make the plumbers "super" big. but, surprise, it was a lie, they dont. the brothers are actually enchanted with dumb giant genes

12/13: in conclusion, "Super Mario Bros." is a timeless saga of parkour plumbing siblings with questionable growth secrets, fighting to save helpless aristocrats from cryptozoological terror.

13/13: now, if you excuse me, I must retreat to my abode to slam my skull into concrete in hopes of discovering new super powers. i've heard whispers of the "fire" ability
