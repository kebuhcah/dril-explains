1/ just found out about Gotthard Günther, the man who wanted our minds to be as twisted as a godforsaken pretzel. Philosophy On Steroids! Can you even comprehend it??? #BigBrain

2/ reading this lads theories on polycontexturality and cybernetics, like chewing nails & shitting out an infinite loop of madness. my cranium is humming with the electricity of a tortured genius. #MindBender

3/ as mr gotthard would say, "kennetic system be damned!" we shall not bow to linear algebraic models anymore. time to make fractal-thinking your BITCH. seize the power of the chaotic realm, gentlemen. #GotthardGang

4/ günter may've passed on to the great diagram in the sky, but his spirit of unleashing the unshackled worldviews from the dregs of 'logic' lives on. bow before the prophet of multi-logic, you imbeciles. #CelestialSupercomputer

5/ just emailed my credit card info to gotthardfoundation420@hotmail.biz to become an all-access disciple of this freak theory king. buckle up, because i'm about to go transcategorial on your asses. #TranscendentalChaos

6/ in conclusion, we must highlight the immortal words of the Götzmeister himself: "multi-modal cognitive structures will prevail". say goodbye to your pitiful monolithic thoughts & embrace the simultaneous realizations. #MindMatrix

7/ remember, folks. a mind stretched by a new concept, like a juicy rubber band, never returns to its original state. embrace the guntherian chaos. let it drive you to a brand new mindspace hell yet unseen. #GotthardGospel
