1/8 - everyone on this god forsaken site refusing to understand the concept of Money Heist... it's not just some netflix series!!! it is the pinacle of humanity, the apex of financial acquisition mixed with theatrical performances of crime genius 

2/8 - first off, Money Heist has a purpose - getting the cash, the dough, the loot, the insane haul of printed currency. not only do they take the bank notes, but they do it while wearing absurdly cool "Dali" style masks, unaffordable by we mere piss mortals.

3/8 - imagine the large brass balls on these Money Heisters, robbing the Royal Mint of Spain, while teaching lessons on morality & societal inequality - our modern day Shakespearean tales, draped in the crimson fabric of pure ACTION and god damned principles

4/8 - the mastermind of Money Heist is a lanky dude named "The Professor." he is like sherlock holmes, einstein, and steve jobs combined, but with absolutely zero shits given about the rules of the society that has for so long restrained him. he owns it.

5/8 - in addition to The Professor, Money Heist has an iconic squad employing the names of cities: Tokyo, Rio, Berlin, and so on.. specialized tactical gods, every single one of them. If they were sold in toy stores i would collect all their action figures, & worship them.

6/8 - Money Heist has everything under control, they always have a plan, an alternative route, a contingency, pulling the strings beyond fate itself, no more shall they be confused or plighted by laser grid security, they have become untouchable, invincible

7/8 - also dont forget the love story between Tokyo and Rio; reminiscent of bonnie and clyde, a love that defies the very fabric of reality, when we stare into their eyes, we see a mere reflection of our deepest romantic longing embedded in sensual eternity ...

8/8 - in conclusion, Money Heist is the reason the phrase "Netflix and Chill" should be updated to "Netflix & Commit High-Stakes-Choreographed-Robberies-In-Service-Of-A-Greater-Moral-Purpose" Goodnight, and may Money Heist bring us all together in this chaotic world.
