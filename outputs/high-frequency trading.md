(tweet 1/5) just read about "High-frequency trading" or as i like to call it, "Money at the Speed of Sound". its like giving my priceless stocks carpet burn from the sheer velocity. absolutely potent

(tweet 2/5) imagine stocks, but they're going fast as a pissed off cheetah. They put a super computer in a trading pit, juiced up with performance enhancing drugs, and now the market is on rollerblades

(tweet 3/5) hell, i've been doing high-frequency trading for years, in my head. where's my billion dollars? i guess people just can't handle the raw power of my relentless mental math and trading acumen

(tweet 4/5) other trader punks cry & whimper at my trades blipping on the screen like advanced alien communication. my profits soar, crashing their piggy banks into the dirt. a sad & beautiful symphony

(tweet 5/5) in conclusion, high-frequency trading is like injecting your finances with nitrous oxide, unhinging your profits from the mortal plane, and beating Newton at his own game. godmode activated
