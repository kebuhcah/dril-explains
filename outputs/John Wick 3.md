1/ just watchd "JOHN WICK 3" the movie, and my mind is absolutely ravaged by the Hellish ballet of bullets and fists these people had to perform . must send congrats to Big Mr wick....

2/ im no gun freak, but Mr wick's extensive armory looks like a dream come true from heaven!! no one, and i mean NO ONE, should be able to tell the depth of a thousand blades and bullets unleashed upon the screen

3/ the evil organization "high table" can really kiss my unwashed ass-cheeks through my jeans ...believe it or not, john wick has cemented his place as my own personal avenger, smashing corportate assholes into oblivion with his pets. 

4/ horseback fighting - we need more of this in society. if you can dominate a horse and a man simultaneously, you've achievd the pinnacle mastery of combat. John Wick has done just that , and we should all bow down. #CowboyWick 

5/ now i dont claim to be a fight expert, but John Wick could easily crush my entire skeleton with a whisper of his mighty grip. sometimes I lie awake at night, praying he shows the same mercy to me as he does to his enemies. 

6/ anyways, JOHN WICK 3 has taught me one thing: no one disobeys The Wick. he is my sword, my shield, my protector. he is the scourge of a thousand cursed innocents, and I stand by him . You hear that, High Table? DO NOT CROSS THE WICK. 

7/ thread end. join me next week when i live-tweet the emotional journey of watching Shrek 2 for the 69th time. god be with u all. #JohnWick3
