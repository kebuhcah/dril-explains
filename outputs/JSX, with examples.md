1/ alright, buckle up yuor asses, because the master of the tweets is here to unravel the dark secrets of the so called "JSX" for the rabid coders that infest this twisted site. prepare to be Enlightened.

2/ now, JSX is not to be confused with DJX, your local high school's techno DJ. No, JSX is when you mix HTML elements into a perverse communion with javascript like a disgusting cake. Keep following my twisted thread for some juicy examples.

3/ first example - this one is for all the perverts out there who want to combine the powers of javascript and goddamn HTML to create: a damn button. here we go:

```
const myButton = <button onClick={this.handleMyClick}>Click me</button>;
```

4/ as you can tell, that so called button it's a beastly fusion of vomitus html and potent javascript, all bound together by brutal curly braces "{ ... }". that's the unholy signature of JSX, a pestilence upon this decrepit virtual land. tag me
#jsx
#horrorsofReactDOM

5/ now it's time for yet another chilling example of the debauchery that is JSX. behold:
```
const mySinfulList = (
  <ul>
    {this.state.myItems.map((item) => <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>)}
  </ul>
);
```

6/ God help us all, for we are damned. in the bowels of the code, the sinister {.map} function creates a cackling assembly line of terror, spewing out one <li> after another like a soulless machine devoid of mercy.

7/ so next time you stumble upon some foul JSX lurking in the depths of a React app, remember to recite the cryptic incantation:
```
import React from 'react';
```
or risk unleashing hell into your accursed JavaScript.

8/ i have now bestowed all my profane wisdom about the forbidden craft of JSX upon the wretched masses. If you have gained proficiency in this dark art, be warned, you are now a member of the elite, feared by all. strive to use this power for good, you petulant children of code.
