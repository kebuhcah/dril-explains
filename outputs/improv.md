1/6:
just found out about this thing called "improv".. where babes & Sick bastards gather in a dimly lit dungeons, to shout & Snicker. i Must experience this Sensation

2/6:
update: i have infiltrated the improv group as "Michael-angelo", a man who can only speak in "Yes, and..." phrases. they suspect Nothing. the power is stupendous

3/6:
the rituals of Improv involve summoning The troupe Master, unlocking The forbidden Zipper, & paying our respects to the ghost of the First Jester that roams this dark moor. my mind yet unwavering

4/6:
behold, a lesson from the teachings of improv: in the Scene you must serve the greater good of your comrades, for only then can you taste the euphoria of unhinged on-stage tomfuckery

5/6:
improv teaches us to revel in the uncertain; how to revamp failure into glory; and become one with chaos, like a newborn dingo in the unforgiving serengeti, beguiled by both the wisdom of the wind and the spirits of the sand.

6/6:
alas, i must retire from this realm of Improv, as I, "Michael-angelo" am being called to engage in other vital crap. but let the record show, that within these walls of comedic uncertainty, I conquered like a king.
