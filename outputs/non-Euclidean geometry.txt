1/ ah, yes. the sacred realm of Non-Euclidean Geometry, where the foolish cry & the wise drink deep from the twisted wells of mind bending space. behold.

2/ in the land of Euclid, all simple polygons are given free entry to local sandwich shops "sum of angles 180" triumphantly declare. but the non-euclidean bad boys scoff, chomp big fucked up triangles; sum of angles @ who the hell even knows

3/ imagine if parallel lines didnt give a shit about each other. just cruising, minding their own business. maybe hooking up & forming world owning shapes that send geometry professors back to their toilet. thats Non-Euclidean life baby

4/ friends we have all heard of triangles, squares & other normie shapes. but have you heard of the not-my-Dad's-math shapes like the hyperbolic dodecahedragon? the squiggly 100000-gons? they rise with fury from the unholy void. Euclid cries

5/ some disdain Non-Euclidean Geometry. "disruptive," they say. "does not meet our expectations for sane academic study." typical cowards, threatened by the reality of a wyrmhole opening inside their dumb protractor. we advance past their relic-thoughts.
