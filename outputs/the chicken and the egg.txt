1/ im looking into the big question right now.. which came first, chicken or egg?? the only way to solve this is with mind blowing logic & not asking any1 who knows about biology

2/ the "Chicken & Egg" question has torn through the annals of great thinkers in history. the blood spilled over these beasts is enough to make a chicken pot pie - still no body knows the true answer.

3/ ok my followers, time for big brain move, think about this - there is nO chicken without Egg. But behold! no egg without chicken!! its absolute chaos.. its enough to make me want to become a vegetarian, and i havent eaten a vegetable since 1998

4/ I propose a new idea that both the chicken and the egg arrived together, in a large grocery bag on God's arm, at the same damn instant to destroy our weak human brains. its time to live in harmony with the paradox. embrace it.

5/ critics tell me to "shut up" and "the egg came first from birds that weren't chickens, dummass." i say theyre jelous of my intelligence, my exploration of eggs and the chicken truths. these haters will not crack my determination.

6/ in conclusion, maybe the truth is beyond us, and it is only in grappling with these perplexing dilemmas, these unfathomable mysteries, that we learn to accept reality -- or lack thereof -- as a giant cosmic joke. egg & chicken? who cares! i sure dont.
