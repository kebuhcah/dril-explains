Tweet 1: just got wind of this new emoticon "ðŸ˜ˆ" and let me tell you buddy, it's like they snuck a grease ball into the zoo of digital faces - this guy needs leashes

Tweet 2: imagine the raw power in dropping a "ðŸ˜ˆ" into a conversation, it's like bridging your ass from hell to wreak havoc on unsuspecting families who use "ðŸ™‚" and the likes

Tweet 3: Folks calling me "electronic devil man" on account of my excessive use of this "ðŸ˜ˆ". I will wear this title with dishonor, as I become the nightmare our founding fathers warned us about.

Tweet 4: just tried to send a smile, phone autocorrected it to ðŸ˜ˆ. we have entered an era where the devil controls communication, good night dumb asses, see you in the abyss
