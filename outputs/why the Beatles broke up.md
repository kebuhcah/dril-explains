tweet 1: "the beatles" -- a band who cranked up the speakers and let loose on some righteous tunes..But ultimately the bastard "Greed" played their swan song.. unforgivable 

tweet 2: rignt now thinking about the time George wanted to make a song about his calculator watch but john started screaming "Let it BE" and now im upset

tweet 3: FACT: each beatle wanted more cigarette breaks than the other... a toxic pissing contest signifying their impending break up. absolutely chilling.

tweet 4: ive heard rumors that the beatles disbanded after arguing over which Ninja turtle they would be. paul said he was all four but john did a big shrug... fucked up

tweet 5: i saw the beatles first hand in my fathers barn, paul glaring at ringo for drumming extra loud during a tender ballad... the crack in the dam wall appeared before my eyes 

tweet 6: some may call yoko ono the catalyst for the dissolving of an iconic group. but it was the petty arguments, like over who first thought of saying "Hello, Goodbye".. chaos 

tweet 7: if i could time travel I'd save the beatles from their own destruction, by showing them the bond between bros transcends petty bullshit like "song royalties"... amen
