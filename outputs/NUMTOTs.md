1/ ah, the humble NUMTOTs, gracing us with their combination of transit fever dreams and urban planning's latest meme-based debauchery. let us bask in their glory - a wint thread: #NUMTOTs

2/ like the paladins of old, the hearty NUMTOTs ride forth on their iron steeds - buses, trains, subways, and all manner of public transportation. armed with an oversized transit map, a gallon of that essential coffee, and the wild spirit of activism, they damn well know where it's at.

3/ behold the Chosen Ones, these crusaders of the urban environment. swooping in with seraphic grace, they chant the anthem of mixed-use development and equitable planning, forever reminding us of the folly of automobiles run rampant.

4/ sing not the tale of the mighty "Rush Hour", nor of the solemn "Single Occupancy Vehicle", but rather hold on to the spirit of the NUMTOT, the fearless rider who defies traffic to catch a bus at 5:31 in the goddamned morning.

5/ the NUMTOTs do not walk alone. no, they ride upon the shoulders of titans, expertly wielding meme formats and graphs as the arsenal of their relentless battle against a world designed for myopic convenience, all while housed within the cozy confines of a Facebook group.

6/ let us never forget the cries of victory that echo throughout the timelines of Twitter: “New Urbanist Memes for Transit-Oriented Teens!” Together, they engage in a dance of celebration, knowing that they've mastered both the art of meme-making and the enigma of urban planning.

7/ in the end, NUMTOTs must stand their ground amid a perennial war, fighting for the very soul of city planning. though they may face scorn or ridicule, their vision keeps them resolute. never shall the urban landscape be taken for granted, so long as these heroes meme on. #NUMTOTs
