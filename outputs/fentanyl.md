1/ Just got wise to some sinister powder called "Fentanyl" wreaking havoc. Absolutely not suitable for seasoning popcorn at family gatherings. #SadDinner

2/ Can't believe I've been using salt this whole time while a cool new drug was lurking in the shadows. Illuminati, goblins, or mother nature?? #fentanylFiasco

3/ "Fentanyl" comes from the Latin word "Fenus," meaning "shit poison." And I must admit, this garbage kills way too often. Why not switch to a healthier lifestyle: drinking pee?

4/ Fentanyl is so powerful u'd think hospitals would use it all the time, but they are cowards. Lets slap some of this devil's dandruff on my nuts and see what happens. #EffectiveOverdose

5/ Final thoughts: If the government is so hell-bent on stopping the Fentanyl epidemic, why not BUILD ROBOTS with an unquenchable desire for the stuff? AI eats it all up, saving humanity. Problem solved.

6/ Seriously though, this Fentanyl menace is destroying lives. If you or someone you know is struggling, reach out for help. That's what heroes do. #FentanylFighters #BeAHero
