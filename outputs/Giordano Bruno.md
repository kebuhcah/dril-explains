1/ Ahh yes, the Notorious Giordano "Big Brain" Bruno - Ultimate wizard of the cosmos, casting nasty knowledge spells on round earth pseudo intellectuals.

2/ Broke from the shackles of Catholic rule to unite us with the infinite worlds in the heavens! Now i can wave to mr Alien in his space boat, thxv Giordano!

3/ Ascended to the rank of FrIaR to sneak-peep Heaven's secrets, only to find out sorcery comes from  staying up all night staring at the stars while guzzling Monster Energy.

4/ Jailed, excommunicated, and barbecued by the Church for daring to say the universe is infinite. "Sorry can't hear over the sound of my mind foaming at the mouth, Pope Man!"

5/ The craziest crime? Schools STILL ignoring Bruno's hard-hitting ideas. Like his conception of the universe as an infinite, interlinked mesh of hot dog stands and gamer desks. 

6/ History tries to teach us about Galileo & Copernicus, but guess what? Giordano Bruno was the ORIGINAL star guy. He critiqued their chalk board nonsense like a professor of ass demolition.

7/ Today we remember Giordano Bruno - the universe whisperer & purveyor of celestial mayhem. May your infinite wisdom continue to shake the church's fragile core.
