1/ my tv malfunctoined again.. forcing me to watch this cool ninja bounty hunter babysitting some green turd with wide eyes. God must have a cruel sense of humor. #Mandalorian

2/ sometimes the Mandalorian takes off his cool helmet and stares longingly into space.. perhaps remembering days without #babyYoda pissing constantly in his line of sight

3/ these space nerds call it "the way".. but i call it the bullshit.. making me keep my damn mask on to preserve some idiotic mystique. who are we really fooling here folks! #Mandalorian

4/ blasting off into deep space in my cyber van with "NO DROIDS ALLOWED" sticker on windshield. staring lovingly at my frog jar as tiny green womb gremlin cowers in fear. we've reached peak #babyYoda

5/ the Mandalorian's cool ninja suit looks like it was forged by satans own blacksmith in the deepest pits of space hell; even my envious bowels churn in jealousy. #Mandalorian

6/ And when the Mandalorian speaks, it's like pouring damn space syrup on my brain. The soothing voice that speaks to every suppressed midlife crisis I've had since #babyYoda entered my life.

7/ in conclusion, the Mandalorian preys upon every weakness in my shit-stained soul while feeding me a steady IV drip of kickass bounty hunting and the ever-growing urge to adopt. perfectly balanced, as God intended. #Mandalorian #babyYoda
