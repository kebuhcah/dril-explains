1/ ah yes, the distinguished- "Deleuze & Guattari" combo, here to cast their absolutely respectabyl thoughts upon my brain cavern, like a demon flipping through a TV schedule

2/ Deleuze labbeled as "rhizome' psyceonaut"" & his main guy Guattari being the "Multiplicity Freak." looking at their wild concepts like Plateaus and Deterritorialization.. what the fuck does this mean..

3/ evry day I inject my self with a micro dose of "Deleuze & Guattari" wisdom, becoming more & more powerful w/ "assemblages,'' the "Body w/ no organs" and the "BWO cheeseburger value meal."

4/ gettin holler'd at by Academia Hogs for sayin' "Deleuze & Guatt[atooth]ari" promote anarchy, yelling into each others toilet paper rolls abt schizoanalysis â€” they dk, we only read for the true memes 

5/ a lot of ppl on this shite, call me Fake Mr. philosophy, for only connecting their names to buffoons. but here's a liste of things I have, in fact, owned: a Deleuze & Guatt[a]ari Timepiece, a D&G shirt.. that is all

6/ pondering.... de-territorialize your mom's basement, but to avoid mommy's wrath, de-commodify that desire, but only enough to make sure the leftovers in the fridge remain yours. Deleuze & Guatteroni ain't got shit on that

7/ so in conclusion, Deleuze & Guattari talkin smooth abt "becoming imperceptible'' when we just blindly scrollin down the timeline at the speed of infinity. damn, guess we're all experts now. shit.
