1/12 alright dipshits buckle up, time to explore the Turkish TV phenomenon "Magnificent Century" - its like "The Crown" at a kebab stand. prepare to kiss the Sultan's golden ass. #MagnificentCentury #SultansOfSwag

2/12 this goddamn series is about Sultan Süleyman the Magnificent - guy apparently managed to get shit done while being surrounded by a bunch of scheming assholes in ridiculous headgear. hats off to his dedication, and hats ON to those funny hats. #SultanSlay

3/12 they call this shit "muhteşem yüzyıl" in turkish, but don't let that fool ya - the soundtracks are so sick even ya basement dwelling ass can vibe to it like a deity on a persian rug. #BopKingSuleiman

4/12 everyones gossipin about women in the harem like its some kind of gory speed dating sesh. Hürrem Sultan, his top concubine, is basically the Beyoncé of Ottoman Empire. bow to the queen, you goddam mad men fans #OttomanGameOfThrones

5/12 Süleyman's best bro/guy pal Pargalı İbrahim Pasha is the sexy political meat in a harem sandwich. let me tell ya, he doesnt burn out easy - though they have some history if yknow what I mean *wink* *wink* #BestiesBeforeJesters

6/12 cant handle the utter collapse of my brain while watching these dope ass characters pull some political jujitsu bullshit shuffling Viziers around the grand stage like a 16th-century episode of survivor on acid. #WheresThePasha

7/12 Sultan Süleyman is an absolute content machine, dishing out poetry like a high cultured buffet at yer drunken toga party. sure as hell has more to offer than my sorry ass tweeting nonsense into the abyss - hire me Süleyman. #GhostwritingForRoyalty

8/12 the big golden hats in this shit are so bombass I can't even cope - would slap one on my noggin 24/7, even while i pick up a fresh pack of adult diapers from your favorite "Diapers" supplier. #MandatoryHeadgear

9/12 anyone who thinks history is boring hasnt seen these spicy meatballs, loaded with love triangles, gruesome executions and FUCKIN' bees running the show at court. the bees know what's good. #InTheKnow

10/12 you nerds either love or hate that they crammed 46 years of Süleyman's reign into 139 episodes - personally i admire the dedication to churning out that much TV, like a sultan of binge-worthy historic drama. #GetYourHistoryOn

11/12 i give "Magnificent Century" a solid 9.5/10 on the dril rating scale - all it needed were hoverboards and a dude chucking beer cans at the Grand Vizier. now let's time travel to when roomba was just a gleam in a young inventor's eye #ApprovalFromDril

12/12 now get outta here and experience the maddeningly addictive orgy of Ottoman Empire drama, and don't forget the popcorn or the fork to stab ya TV when the betrayal is just. too. real. #WatchResponsibly
