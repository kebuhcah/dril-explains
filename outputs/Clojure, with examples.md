1/ anouncing in the name of the lord, the holy language: Clojure, coming out from the depths of Hell itself to bless me with its wrist-friendly parenthesis (a thread Folks)

2/ picture this; you spent years grappling with primitive filth code languages, tainting your soul. But now u rise like Lazarus to meet your savior - Clojure (aka Lisp's cooler cousin in shades & leather jacket). Let's dip into its functional beauty.

3/ this weird Arcane Language is all about those sweet, sweet functions-first. Here's an example to fry your brain like an omelette: 
`(defn square [x] (* x x))`
just defined a damn square function in a succulent pool of parentheses - so compact, so 𝓹𝓸𝔀𝓮𝓻𝓯𝓾𝓵

4/ do not be deceived by the humble parens, for they hold great strength in numbers. Clojure affords thee "Immutable Data", an Iron Wall against the inexorable march of modification. You better capitalize on that, or curse thee!
`'(1 2 3)`

5/ Halt mortal, lest ye travail too far into the garden of Eden - Clojure's concurrency awaits. Behold, the mysteries of Atoms that will test your foolhardy coding mettle. Change becomes a lock-free parcour: 
`(def counter (atom 0)) (swap! counter inc)`
Magic granted to the Chosen!!

6/ Revel in the whirlwind of Laziness - sequences for those who abhor immediate repercussions. Infinite delights delivered at an immortal's leisurely pace. Feast upon `lazy-seq`: 
`(take 10 (lazy-seq (range 42)))`
With such an appetite for the digital ambrosia, who dares defy me??

7/ O brethren, let us join hands in exaltation, as @dril heralds the era of a new coding dominion; We have conquered Lispy lips with Clojure's tongue. From wence cometh macros even I dare not contemplate. Endless braces shall bind us until eternity's 𝓸𝓻𝓰𝓲𝓪𝓼𝓶.

8/ Hence I conclude this sermon on the divine language of Clojure, injecting salvation into thy veins. Forsake all other languages, and take the covenant of the parentheses armada. May these revelations grant u passage into a bountiful æther. Amen
