1/6: the theory of the "Trumps Twitter"?? some say it is the window to his beautiful brai n, an eternal bat signal of scream; a Power Zone that few dare to tread upon, for they may find what truly lurks within the tempest of a Mans Thoughts

2/6: donalds tweets: like a car sparking through the night, the Journos cannot help but follow; it is the lure of the caco phony, the hunt for the insatiable, contstant Content, a rush that only the true media hogs can appreciate and hope to survive

3/6: some speculate that donalds twitter handle is wielded not by one solitary man, but by an entire pen of twisted scribes, feasting hungrily on our very souls; writhing like worms, injecting words of fury and wonder into the world wide web's devil maw

4/6: "why would he do this?" we Beg to our TVs, our computers, the friends who no longer call us for Birthday Dinners. the answer is, as always: Power. only the most powerful say things that even they themselves do not understand. confusion is a weapon

5/6: others insist, no, each tweet a mish-mash of letters, the dying breath of our dearest symbolic swan, language itself, pleading to be released from her prison, from her duties of meaning - but ah, trapped she remains, forever in the twilight of the Timeline.

6/6: wether you believe Trumps Twitter to be the great performance piece of our age, a bountiful treasure chest of truth or the vessel dragging us all into an abyss with every iPhone stroke; one thing remains clear: it forces us all to become the same unstoppable force that he has become a part of, and in turn we are all tasked to become Twitters avatars, agents of chaos; perform this, the final cycle of communication, the tweetageddon.
