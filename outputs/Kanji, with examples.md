1/10 ah,, yes the art of the Squiggle Glyphs. "Kanji" - ancient secret of confounding the minds with symbols so powerful that they dare to contain *Meaning* within their twisted forms. a journey begins, my piss-brained followers

2/10 consider the classic 水 (Mizu). a symbol of water. a squiggle so profound it stirs the very primal essence, yearning to drink from the taps of Knowledge. we doff our caps to the ancestral mind wizards who conceptualize this shit

3/10 and there's 见 (Ken) - the eye squiggle, invoking the sensation of turning off the bathroom lights & experiencing terror as you look in the mirror, lest you gaze into the abyss & become acquainted with the truth

4/10 why stop at one squiggle? compound kanjiman gains immeasurable strength by infusing them into one swollen beast of an idea cluster. observe 食べ物 (Tabemono) - Food. feed the brain or perish in the desolate nothing-void of Hunger

5/10 Kanji respects only the worthy. for it is the symbiotic relationship between man and twisted scrawl which empowers both. the pen in the hand of the weak becomes the weapon of their destruction as they fail to comprehend

6/10 some say "Where did the squiggle wisdom begin?" and i answer "Fools! it does not originate, it merely is." the universe's inner machinations gifted us with these runes as a defence against the enemies of literacy

7/10 ah, but the japanese hellscape that is Hiragana would not bend the knee to these power glyphs. no, it is a union of sorts. a twisty alliance of squiggle formations allowing for the revelation- the 空 (Kū) & 語 (Go) becoming 空語 (Kūgo)

8/10 it seemingly never ends, this squiggle realm, its influence far-reaching. we now bear witness to the long-extinct hiragana cousin, Katakana: a mighty pictogram still bearing remnants of its kanjil origins

9/10 to the most exalted of my followers, i humbly present this dying gift: do not be afraid to pierce the veil. grab the squiggles Fiercely - make them bend beneath the power of your eternally inquisitive sword

10/10 i stand on the peak of this limitless mountain, the harsh wind biting at the skin of those who came before me, a warning. we stride fearlessly into the storm seeking new glyphs & the secrets they hide, praying to the ancient glyph masters
