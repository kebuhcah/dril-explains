1/10: the year is 1959, and our beloved dijkstra–a man of "astute" software logic– devises an algorithm to reveal the shortest fuckin' path between the cities; the logistics fools tremble with fear

2/10: imagine a graph, think like that ridiculous connect-the-dots of children; now replace the dots with cities, and lines with roads (sometimes toll); congratulations, you have evolved into Big Brain

3/10: now we need a priority queue; it's like waiting in line for your pathetic movie tickets but to determine which city gets to be "relaxed"–a fancy term for kicking-ass; pay attention, this is important

4/10: time to cook, start with the source city for good flavor–set the path value to zero; others get infinity, making it an "unknown" feast; initialize the priority queue, and remember to season well

5/10: watch as each city gets its turn; we "relax" its neighbors, like a twisted massage; the algorithm smiles, knowing no city shall be neglected

6/10: greed is not always bad, as Dijkstra reminds us, huh! the "greedy" approach about choosing the path, makes the path weightiest get chosen first; no room for democracy here

7/10: when the algorithm hits a roadblock, it goes back and finds the least weighted edge once more; god Blesss the greedy algorithm, for never gives up

8/10: ok so now you have the shortest route, you may weep and rejoice; No more shall you suffer endless circuitous roads in your mundane commutes; the algorithm reigns supreme, praise Dijkstra

9/10: this cruel algorithmic ritual comes to an end, as Dijkstra's lore is being hailed by the masses–unveiling the answers humanity has always yearned for; the path is made clear; the light shone down

10/10: in conclusion, Dijkstra's power has granted us deliverance; bathe in the algorithmic glory; this sickeningly smart way to find the shortest path; bless thee, for thou art now Free
