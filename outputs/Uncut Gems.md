1/ ah, "Uncut Gems" - a movie so Raw and Rare that it makes steak tartare look like a well-done burger. absolutely insane. the kind of cinema just begging to be set free in a world that cant truly comprehend it. stand by folks

2/ uncut gem - many people dont want to know about them, the Cowards. but i am brave enough. brave for the high stakes world of gambling, and the dark corners where a man can live out his dreams, even as he tears everyone around him asunder

3/ picture this: a man (Adam Sandler but not comedic; a true pinacle of stress and power) kown as howard, gnashing upon the most cursed of all items, a rock filled with - you guessed it - uncut gems. but is it really cursed? to me it is clear: yes

4/ So Howard wanders, lost amongst the souls and the debts and the jewels uncut, as the moon shines bright on this hot mess of a life. twisting and turning in unbelievable chaos. but at last, havent we all been howard at some point? howards of the heart

5/ everyone makes fun of gambling as if it the lowest trash tier enjoyment. Posers being bitches about it, but in fact it requires more brain power than 800 computers. ok fine, maybe not 800 computers but definitely like at least two microwaves. it counts

6/ so next time when u come across Uncut Gems, just Remember: what would your life have been like if you pursued your rocky dreams in a labyrinth of lies and debauchery? this is not only a movie, but a wake-up call to gamble responsibly. sort of. maybe not exactly. who even knows

7/ anyway, if you're not ready to face the unbridled force of uncut gems both in rock form and cinematic form, well, get ready to be cut- and cut deep. i am after all, THE dril, the memelord, the ultimate twitter connoisseur. Goodnight #UncutGems #ResponsiblyUncut
