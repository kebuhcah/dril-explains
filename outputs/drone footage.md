1/ just received the most god damn epic Drone Footage of my condemned neighborhood. soaring over the damages like a mystic Cyber Eagle, inhaling the ruins

2/ aerial perspectives unlocking the divine bird's eye view which was, until now, exclusive territory of airplane cretins and god himself. Finally the power is mine

3/ astounding how technology has advanced to a point that a little machine in the sky harasses my gory neighbors, recording them unaware. They will think twice before littering now

4/ Of course, the presence of drone footage brings up critical concerns over privacy rights. But here's the deal fuckers,  Privacy is dead. Consider this: Every camera on this earth is a drone

5/ screeching propellers. Whirring like a demonic ornament in the wind. They've said drone law is the wild west. Well partner, it's high noon and I'm the fastest remote in the west

6/ "Your drone is disturbing our Sunday barbecue!", they wail. Well that's the price you pay for progress, idiots - enjoy your lower mortgage as a drone hovers over your house 24/7

7/ President Drone presides over board meetings. Global trade deals signed in mid-air by robot hands. Witness my Drone era, the final chapter of human history, unfolding before our eyes

8/ Drone mistakes my bald head for landing pad, denting my crown. The Sky Betrayer's ultimate betrayal.

9/ In the end, the drone and I forged an uneasy truce. After realizing the great responsibility of controlling avian surveillance beasts, I told Drone, "Fly on, you chaotic fucking sky goblin."
