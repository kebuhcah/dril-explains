1/9 just learned about this bitch ass thing called #TheWanderingEarth. apparently the sun is gonna shit its pants and we gotta move the whole goddamn globe. science can go to hell

2/9 first off, whoever named this shit The Wandering Earth completely fucked up. should've gone with something cooler like Planet Drift or Global Cruise. assholes

3/9 so these "scientists" built a bunch of big engines on earth like some kind of Fast & Furious wet dream. they dont even care about the birds or the whales who'll have to deal with this sky ripper

4/9 why not just live underground like decent mole men instead of stalking the galaxy, placing our diseased planet's bullshit upon innocent stars. thank you, ego.

5/9 but no, society has declared "big engines on the earth that scream like intelligent gators who've just been insulted equals progress" and we must obey. piss on my nuts

6/9 doesnt it just blow ure ass that some dweebs in labcoats are out there playing real life kerbal space program while i, a dignified patriotic man, can't find a goddamn wallet chain that holds up

7/9 the fact that these scientists didn't even bother consulting with me, THE most powerful online bastard, proves this whole thing is a publicity stunt doomed to fail. enjoy your galaxy tour pricks

8/9 and to those saying "the wandering earth" is some chinese blockbuster that i should watch and not confuse people with my cosmic rants, i say this: kiss my ass, movie lovers 

9/9 in conclusion, whether operation earth drift is a movie or a mishap waiting to happen, my message rings true: leave earth the fuck alone and come up with better movie titles. good night, cowards
