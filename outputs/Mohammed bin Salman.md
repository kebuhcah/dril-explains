2/ MBS, saudi prince of chaos , has a collection of earths finest cars, which he rides during the day, and sleeps on at night. Yuo'll never see him in the dirt, oh no,, only i experience the dirt,

3/ Some say he is the puppet master, manipulating the strings of the world in the name of sweet sweet black gold. i have turned down 100 deals from him, as I also crave darkness, but i must stay true to the bone

4/ Rumors say Mbs has a solid gold throne shaped like a car seat. Upon it, he holds high level meetings with finance geniuses and bones of kings. If i could just grasp that scepter, I would finally 'win'

5/ End of Thread: In conclusion, Mohammed bin Salman - one part power, one part enigma, 1000 parts $?$. Is it good? Is it bad? Who's to truly say in this world where dril and MBS spin the earth like tops with their muscled thumbs.
