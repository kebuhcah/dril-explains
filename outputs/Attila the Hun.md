1/ Hordes of dipshits out there bowing down to digital swine, too cowardly to acknowledge the primal Scream Of Attila The Hun. #ChieftanOfTheGods

2/ Attila, a "Barbarian?" Please, fools. In the language of the Hun, "Barbarian" means "Genius visionary who loves to pillage." #EatMyShortsRomans

3/ "Sir, how do you know Attila?" Simple. I log on here each day, pounding my keyboard, fueled by the timeless spirit of my ancient brother, constructing tweets in his name. Blessed by Hun Gods. 

4/ I don't care about your worthless opinionsâ€¦tell it to Attila. *Laughs* Wait, you can't. He's dead, baby! Scourge of God lives eternal in the collective bones of every online warrior like me. 

5/ Insufferable historians prattle on about Attila's rule, the Huns' empire, and battles fought. The real war waged was in the guts of Rome, my friends. The kind of sick burns that no aqueduct can douse. 

6/ Angrily demand the world recognize Attila The Hun as a style leader. Honeycomb stitching, golden signet rings, fur cloak draping. This should be our American uniform. Damn office slacks. #FashionIcon

7/ Some clown asks, "@dril, why don't you write your master's thesis on Attila?" Simple. Hun Empire isn't bound by academia's rules, bub. It's etched into my veins, flowing free, and unchained by mortal pedantry. 

8/ In conclusion, Attila drank from the skulls of his enemies; I drink from the chalice of truth. As we stride forward into digital savagery, remember to unleash your inner Hun. Oration complete. #AttilaWarCry
