1/ im no expert but i must Inform every One of the demonic Digital seduction we are subconsciously being drawn into. i have Investigated... "Despacito". prepare to have your minds Blasted.

2/ we all have Heard of it. Des*pacito. a weaponized Euphony, irresistible to the unsuspecting soul. its Infectiousness forces Bodies to pulsate... for whom? i will find its Master.

3/ Latin Fusion sensibilities have intertwined with modern Pop's Siren Call. part of the insidious Scheme to trap our mortal bodies in its Velvet Cage. dance? Perhaps yes. but at what Cost?

4/ the lyrics. spanish Mumbo jumbo hiding the True message. what is it? i cannot translate. but i will Assure you, it will Control your very Heart beats, your Desires. the secret Language of Sin.

5/ one must not Blame these "musicians". they too are Victims. seduced themselves by the Melodic Baubles, shirking their Duties. creating and Recreating, binding Man to the lurid sounds.

6/ we must Exercise restraint. i will not Fall to this musical Demon. my resolve cannot be Shaken. i pledge to Dance with caution, Desp*acito... softly... slow. the only way.
