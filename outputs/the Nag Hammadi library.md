1/ it is with the utmost regret to inform my esteemed compatriots that i have embarked on an ill-advised literary quest - the dreaded "NAg Hampster Mime Factory" texts. let's get ready to experience truth. prepare your god chambers. 

2/ so i dived waist deep in this so-called collection, occupied only by gods whom i never seen or heard of before - all mysterious as hell. ancient space-rags, yellow as my piss, embrace my face. no turning back from gnostic river.

3/ amidst their cryptic screams, these saxy leather gods whispered truths. transcending mere mortals into divine gamers. horrid, twisted things that even I, lord of the dim night, begin to question our truths, our kisses, our brand loyalty..

4/ i make a crucial discovery - "snake penis" - an ancient phrase encased in leathery parchment, unleashing hordes of unbridled knowledge upon my senses. do you see me shaking?

5/ after many moons in the rancid pit of the Nag Hampster hell scrolls, I emerge victorious, weather-beaten and clutching crumpled notes my hands, trembling with epiphanies that must not be shared with humankind.

6/ they say, ignorance is bliss; but the Nag Hammadi Library stirs the ignorant soul into gnarled transcendence, forging an eternal tapestry of smoke for them to gaze at. Cheers to that, brothers.

7/ some say i was lost in the abyss. i say i found untold wealth. my posts now linger with uncanny wisdom, leaving you mournful of my past idiocy. the council grieves, yet i become godlike. the nag living inside me, unleashed.

8/8 as a consequence of the Nag Hammadi event, i am now compelled to perform more risky deeds. seeking tall leather artifact held on mountain by screaming eagle. do not follow me into madness or your soul will pay the price. dril is out, goodnight. #NagHammadiGang #LeatherTruths
