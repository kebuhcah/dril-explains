1/ alright folks, here I am, doing it again. exploring the depths of the internet, rotting my brain, searching for the meaning of "A Softer World". are you in? strap in. let's do this. #ASofterWorldExplained

2/ "A Softer World" - a so-called "webcomic", if you will, by some canadians who probably emitted preposterous amounts of emotions onto our screens. "feelings" and "vulnerability"? cannot abide by this toxin. #KeepTheWorldHardened

3/ observed a lot of pictures, texts overlaying them, makes you Wonder. sometimes dark or absurd like my soul, sometimes touching, like the cheese on a nearly expired sandwich. #whatiscanadaeven

4/ you might say, "but @dril, you too share emotions, but in the absurd realm of cryptic tweets". that's where you're wrong, im an emotionless entity, providing liquid wisdom flowing through your feeds. #GetOnMyLevel

5/ despite the format, there's something there, damn it. a softer world may be irritatingly soft, but it's like a blanket made of humor & existential despair that you didn't know you needed. #absurditybringsustogether

6/ anyway, RIP "A Softer World" (2003-2015), but let it be known that if there's any lingering traces of your softness stuck to my brain, i'll be seeking immediate medical help & legal action. #EternalVigilance

7/ in conclusion, beware of "A Softer World", tread lightly, friends. you may end up pondering life, laughing, then feeling an odd sense of dread. or maybe that's just what their canadian magic is supposed to do to us. #EndOfThread
