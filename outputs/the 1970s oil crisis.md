1/ Oil Crisis 1973: When the world's automobiles fell into a horrid gasoline pit of despair, and the only way out was for people to wear wider pants so they can shove more barrels into them. A thread.

2/ Imagine waking up one day, opening your window, and all the gas stations have a line longer than a CVS receipt. It's not a joke, my friends. It's the real deal. A cabal of oil tycoons with mustaches stood over a map cackling, "No pour you."

3/ Enter OPEC. Sounds like a poker game started by bored accountants, but it's not. These Oil Kings huddle around a crystal ball and dictate which nations shall prosper and which shall thirst for sweet crude. The good news? They gave us the gift of "Odd-Even Gas Days."

4/ Endless wars over a few tanks of unleaded, tying in with an economic boom utterly shot to shit. It's the 70s baby, everyone's favorite decade to bitch about, and it's raining Oil. Disco dancing our way to petroleum oblivion.

5/ Mystifying gas prices sour the skies like unholy demons, making Mad Max look like a training video for middle management. Road trips are now a luxury only enjoyed by those who pull money out of their ass. The irony of exploiting resources so we can go nowhere in style.

6/ Cars practically shape-shifting into smaller boxes on wheels, they're getting so desperate for fuel, soon they'll run on piss & vinegar. It was said, "If you don't like the weather, wait 10 minutes." Now the mantra is, "If you don't like gas prices, drink motor oil instead."

7/ Finally, there's the preposterous mile-long lines for a cup of gasoline. People trading collectible stamps for a drop of engine gold. The gas shortage bringing out the best in humanity: growling, hoarding, and siphoning from their neighbor's gas tanks.

8/ And so the disco era went up in flames, culminating in a world awash in oil panic like it was the cocaine of the 70s. The gas pumps ran dry, but the oil crisis flooded us all in a sick dance of tight pants, wide collars, and thirst for progress.
