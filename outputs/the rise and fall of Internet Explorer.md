1/ ah yes, the internet explorer. the browser of the common man. a relic, a testament, a God forsaken curiosity that lives eternally on your desktop, refusing to be uninstalled

2/ in the beginning there was darkness, and then the Gates decreed "let there be internet explorer" and there was light. The people gasped in wretched awe as windows burst forth with digital nectar

3/ the ascendancy of the explorat: one click and a million possibilities. the connoisseur of data, the man's defenestration of true luxury. with reckless abandon, we browsed to corners of the web shrouded in mist

4/ the era of war: the thunderous march of the void browsers, the pretenders to the throne. Chrome, Firefox, Safari, a merciless onslaught. The internet explorer, once considered invulnerable, upon its haunches

5/ rise of the add-ons: pugilists armed with countless plugins, necks adorned with toolbars, the relentless march against dear exploro bore fruits of destruction, urging its desolation into the void

6/ we pay silent tribute to you Internet Explorer, though your features are decrepit, your load times slumber may your memory linger on. you forged the path we all wander in the realm of the web and for that we salute thee

7/ the era is dead. And yet, it may live forever in our hearts... or as an automatic update we cannot ignore. As almighty Gates closes a window, the dawn of the Edge ensues, a harrowing plunge into the unknown

8/ in conclusion. pour one out for internet explorer, our lost comrade in the browse wars, gathering dust in the shadows of its own creation. time may pass, but not the splendor of the grand old gent that graced our screens. Goodnight sweet prince
