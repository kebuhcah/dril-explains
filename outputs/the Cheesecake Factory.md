1/6 finally entered the hallowed halls of the fabled "Cheesecake Factory" after years of whispers and mythic tales from depraved locals. this place reeks of decadence & culinary excess, like the piss stained roman ruins, begging for divine retribution. #cursedeatery

2/6 behold the chaos: 20-page menus. severed cheesecake heads of our forefathers arranged in artful stacks, a monument to human hubris. servers toil, drenched in sweat and crushed by the weight of eternal penance. there's a dark aura in this place - unmistakable & unrelenting

3/6 refusing direct eye contact with any of the cursed desserts. only scoundrels and the damned have the courage (or stupidity) to indulge. the "man" next to me slurps his penne pasta, liquefying it in his maw of twisted greed. "respectable dining" is a macabre joke here

4/6 bathroom ordeal. a palatial tomb lined with broken faucets and grotesque, cathedralesque mirrors; where every man's inevitable moral demise is starkly reflected. tortuous fragrance engulfs the senses, as if a priest's stole smothering my face. absolutely wretched

5/6 emerging from the culinary hellscape, waitstaff sneer as they attempt to hawk their decadent garbage upon me - but I refuse to bend the knee. to buy factory cheesecake is to spit upon the graves of our sacred ancestors. my heroes died for better dessert, and so will I

6/6 wrenched myself out of the Cheesecake Factory, like a recently birthed calf, gasping for air & slick with moral grime. to slice through that cake is to plunge a knife through the very soul of humanity. too vile to partake; too intriguing to look away. curse you, cheese demon
