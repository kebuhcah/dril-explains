1/ Ahh yes, the sacred realm of DRIVER'S ED. The place where boys become men, and men become gods. I enter the class, wearing my fingerless gloves, ready to assert dominance on the so called "Rules of the Road".

2/ First lesson: the INSTRUCTOR, a tired man, tells us "hands at 10 and 2" like a damn clock? Fools. I grip the wheel with extreme 6 and 9 energy, unlocking the true potential of vehicle control. Gas & brake pedals tremble beneath my mighty boots.

3/ Parallel Parking - a twisted dance of the automobile forbidden by nature itself. I approach the curb, swerving like a slithering snake in heat. Onlookers gasp in awe as I merge with the asphalt, transcending the pit of parked plebeians.

4/ The MANUAL - a cruel joke devised by elders to confuse the youth. I burn it in protest, ingesting the ashes to absorb the knowledge contained within. Road safety? More like road anarchy. The high way is my kingdom now, subject to my sovereign rule.

5/ TURN SIGNALS - a coward's illusion. The pamphlet says "communicate with other drivers." Pah! A true driver reads the mind of his opponents like a twisted game of asphalt psychic warfare. I deconstruct your intentions from careful observations of your Bumper Sticker.

6/ Road Signs - hieroglyphic warnings from the asphalt gods. STOP, YIELD, ONE WAY, a language of control & power best left for lesser minds. I ascend beyond pedestrian runes, navigating the roadscape by celestial guidance, divine whispers in the passing wind.

7/ In the end, the instructor sobbingly hands me a license, forged from the fires of vehicular torment. It is done. I am the master of the road and all within my mighty metallic chariot. Tremble, motorist scum, for @dril rides among you, an unstoppable force of vehicular chaos.

8/ The saga of DRIVER'S ED concludes with the mantra I now impart to you - "When behind the wheel, one must awaken their primal lust for chaos, and tame it, forging it into a weapon against the tyranny of traffic." Make way, for I have become the Ultimate Motorist. #RoadRulesOrElse
