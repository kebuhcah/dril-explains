1/ Tired: Netflix & Chill. Wired: Dutch East India Company & go absolutely Bossanova sh*t insane on spices'n trade routes. It's called history you hogs.

2/ 1602: "time to Kick this baby Off by legal monopoly & exploiting asian resources" say Dutch dawgs. A perfect storm of commerce & depravity brews

3/ Weaklings to Dutch East India Co Beast: "hey.. Um. . mayb plan on being less greasy & brutal?" The Beast:"I. Don't . CARE !! I. Love . PROFIT."

4/ hear me out folks: empires fuck up the world w/ capitalism & we sit in awe, munching on some of thier evil cinnamon. Just think about it !!

5/ When VOC (& spoilers : theyre f*cked) reaches peak status, they whip a single tear from their glass eye & whisper "This is truly excellent"

6/ Scramble 4 the Spice â€” thes sick freaks make it like a goddamn Mario Kart race across continents, just 2 get Nutmeg, The Lord's Candy. gory.

7/ me, laying on my disgusting floor, looking up at my world map, whispering . "Dutch East India Company... you brilliant, twisted old bastards".

8/ And when it all falls apart, when the beasty's grip is hanging by a thread, dey belly laugh & say "dam u Dutch East India Co, u had it all."

9/ Congrats to the VOC for inventing modern capitalism and a live action equivalent of the Monopoly board game, bringing chaos to mankind. Bravo.
