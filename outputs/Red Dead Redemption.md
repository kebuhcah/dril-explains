1/ Just saddled up on this realistic cowboy life simulator "Red Dead Redemption" - the horses crap in real-time, how's that for immersion?

2/ Accidentally shot my own horse in Red Dead while trying to wave to fellow gamers online. Now my horse corpse is sliding down a cliffside. C'est la vie, I suppose.

3/ they say you can form deep & meaningful bonds with your #HorseFellas on this red dead malarkey. meanwhile, i can't stop getting kicked by the same horse for getting too close to its back.

4/ Interacting with non-playable characters in this wild west land called Red Dead Redemption: Greet. Gruff. Rob. Antagonize. The four emotional corners of the human psyche.

5/ My posses in Red Dead Online are not fooling around, they're chasing me on horseback for 3+ hours trying to extract the griffin they believe is at my core.

6/ To the man who lassoed me and dragged me through digital mud in "Red Dead Redemption 2 Online": Sir, you have deeply wounded me. I will now throw myself into the mouth of a bear in game and real life as restitution.

7/ Riding my rickety horse through ancient, majestic landscapes while pondering life's greatest mysteries, like: "Is Dutch still reading the goddamn bible?"

8/ "ah yes, i will walk into this saloon and impress these 1899 cowboys with tales of the future" - gets punched square in the face, trampled by a horse, and falls into a trough full of pig shit immediately.

9/ Conclusi√≥n: Don't play #RedDeadRedemption2 if you value your sanity or personal relationships. That being said, I'm off to find the ghost of my hat after my horse bucked it into a river. Farewell, for now, pardner.
