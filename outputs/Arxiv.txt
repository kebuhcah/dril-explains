1/6 alright listen up dipshits, it's time i grab the internet by the balls and explain the glorious realm of "Arxiv" to you morons, as my god given right as memelord supreme. strap yourselves in.

2/6 imagine a beautiful paradise where nerds can release their pent up equations and academic jargon like an insane hose of knowledge, spraying it all over the unsuspecting public. sounds terrifying, but it's a gift from the confused heavens. i call it, "science torrenting"

3/6 to tread the harsh landscapes of "ArXiv" is to witness the raw humanity and sacrifice for truth; a realm where the finest minds slave away at noble causes like "improving pizza making algorithms" or "calculating the optimal balance of a video game controller". God's work.

4/6 but with great power comes great confusion. the sheer avalanche of information, enough to pulverize the brain into dust, tests my incredible intelligence to its absolute limits. as a Twitter king, i bow before no science, but i warn you weaklings: it's for the strong only.

5/6 Understanding ArXiv is like chugging 50 cans of energy drink, motorcycling across the countryside while reciting pi to the millionth digit, & blasting "We Didn't Start the Fire" on repeat. AND YET, as a humble memelord, i shall stay devoted to its mystic torrents of genius.

6/6 So i say to you, my friends and peasants alike: dare to Arxiv, for it is a divine gift, a testament to our unyielding quest for knowledge. May we steer clear of the siren call of hubris, as we venture headfirst into the triumphant & unforgiving sea of human potential. #amen
