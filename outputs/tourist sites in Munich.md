1/ ah, the so-called glamorous "münchen," germany's precious gem.. this thread will expose the secrets within it. hold on tight, coward tourists. #MunichExposed

2/ first up: the english gardens. do not be fooled by the name, they are in fact in germany. spent hours strolling here, desperately looking for the queen's tea. she wasn't fuckin there. #Misleading

3/ marienplatz, a diabolical town square where the glockenspiel clock barks and shrieks every day like a sinful automaton. time is an illusion in this hellish square #ClockTyranny

4/ behold: the frauenkirche. a church where locals say you can see the devil's footprint. well guess what? they don't even let you in with sandals. cheapskates. #NoShoeNoService

5/ ah, the Deutsches Museum. a magical wonderland where nerds take their children to let their minds rot with facts. keep the kids pure, keep them unburdened by knowledge. #IgnoranceIsStrength

6/ finally: lets talk about Hofbräuhaus München. every person here who gave me an "authentic" pretzel lied. salty bread ropes cannot and will not contain my powerful ideas. #ResistPretzel

7/ thats it for now. if any tourists dare test my knowledge of munich, remember, i now have the wisdom of all the pretzels. fear my expanding intellect. and enjoy munich responsibly. #MunichMaster
