1/ Just learned about these Tic Tac shaped motherfuckers they call "Minions"–apparently they dominate our pathetic culture. Each one of them like a little hotdog bastard straight from hell. God help us.

2/ Trying to wrap my brain around the sheer power of these yellow freaks who exist solely to serve evil. They've infiltrated our mundane lives, making millions laugh with their sick twisted humor.

3/ "Banana"–the bedrock of Minion language. A fruit with a dark undercurrent transcending far beyond our linguistics. I refuse to trust anyone who uses the term "Banana" henceforth.

4/ Despite their treacherous nature, I must admit, I do appreciate their devotion to matching outfits. Coveralls out the ass. Honestly, kind of jealous of their streamlined wardrobe.

5/ The Minion Industrial Complex is a force that only grows stronger. A big shot CEO, Gru, probably laughs from his moonbase while these demonic oompa loompas steal our hearts and wallets.

6/ In conclusion, it is with great disgrace & despair that I profess my grudging respect for these hellish pill-shaped gremlins. They've beat us at our own game of absurdity, & thus, earned the title "Minion". #MinionsHivemind
