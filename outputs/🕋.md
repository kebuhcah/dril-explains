Finna pilgrimage this year to touch the black rock like the Ultimate Cube Handler, a title I so desperately crave. I don't even care if they don't let me wear my tactical sunglasses. #CubeToucher

The energy radiating from the grand cube ðŸ•‹ during prayers must be off the absolute charts. Imagine harnessing that power for "Online". A chaos yet to be seen. #SacredSwarm

Haters will say I worship this grand ðŸ•‹, and that's fine. I am merely another man on this spinning orb, humbled in the presence of the natural phenomena that is the holy cube. #DrilbowingToGeometry

In conclusion, the grand cube ðŸ•‹ is a marvel, a beacon for those seeking solace and strength in this wretched world. It is the most powerful shape and I will be constructing many replicas in Minecraft. #CubismRevolution
