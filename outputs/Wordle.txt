1/7 just found out about this thing called WORDLE. it's the classic battle of Man Vs. Word. mind games with god damn letters. possibly designed by the intelligence community.

2/7 wordle challenges my huge brain to guess a demon's secret word. stealing my thoughts to come up with LETTERS?? im responsible for these words' creation. Word Alchemy.

3/7 struggling with Wordle once again. transcoding cosmic knowledge backwards into pithy 5 letter words like "Gorby". who benefits from this? not me. the word chose itself. cannot be stopped.

4/7 they say "share your score" but i will never allow my considerable intellectual prowess to be reduced to a simple number. Weak minds seek retweets, exceptional minds seek the truth.

5/7 after 800 failed attempts at wordle, i take a drag off a cig, squinting through smoke, 'shit...what's the word?' i realized that in this world, the word was the least important part... but the game owned us

6/7 confronted with the sheer non-importance of wordle in the cosmic scale of life's mysteries, undeterred, my finger hovers over the letter 'V'. Is this my final stand against the cold indifference of language?

7/7 wordle, you may have bested me today, but know this: you have only solidified my resolve. you've awakened a sharp mind with an insatiable appetite for revenge, and I WILL have it. we're just getting started.
