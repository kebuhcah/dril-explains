1/ just found out about the "nso group". theyre like the genius bar at apple store but for hacking into gory devices against bad people. pretty sick how good guys always win...

2/ apprently these NSO fellas can unlock your entire nasty gadget and listen to your weirdest conversatons. probably laughing at the little man while guzzling gasoline from a martini glass

3/ nso should consider doing PARTNERSHIP with the faceless telecom giants...maybe build a Gaming App that hacks enemy gamers in real time.. completely dominating the phone landscape like MOSES

4/ observing the posts on this website, I conclude that NSO must be building a power plant in the sky that will siphon off our data like the bad angels in movies. pretty sure i saw something similar the other day, but it might have been a flying shoe

5/ if nso hacks into my phone, they'll just find folders full of high quality jpegs of dogs driving cars which are only for educational purposes. let them drown in a hellscape of beautiful race dogs

6/ thinking about my revenge against nso by creating my own hacking army, equipped with the sharpest tools in the shed, like pencils and super magnets. good luck with your plans when i can erase your computer from 2 feet away

7/ in conclusion, nso group basically hovers around us, waitng for the perfect moment to PUT_THE_HACK_ON_YOU, but us ordinary giants of the world must carry on, our secrets trapped within the shadows of the internet encrypted fortress. theirs to claim
