3/6 - but Fugger didn't forget about FAMILY! no sir..started the biggest renaissance fam ever. ended up with more wives & kids than fingers to count 'em, absolutely DOMINATING fertility.

4/6 - if those MEDIEVAL PEASANTS wanted to get rich, they'd have to beg JAKOB "baller" fugger for a slice of the pie or sell their livestock for chump change. he said NO CRYPTO, or you're on your ass!!
