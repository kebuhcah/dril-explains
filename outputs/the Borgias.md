1/ Ah yes, the Borgias... or as I like to call them, the "Spicy Renaissance Bad Boys". A family that did crimes "Italian style" and made the Pope their hype man. 

2/ A family so powerful, they turned sibling rivalry into an art form. Cesare, who probably watched too many mob movies and got a bit too into character. 

3/ Lucrezia was like "I can do politics too" but her brothers were like "Oh yeah? Bet you can't ;)" So she went "watch me" and allegedly poisoned a grand total of both villains and potential husbands. A true Renaissance woman.

4/ And you got Pope Alexander VI, aka "Big Daddy" Rodrigo. Church? This guy was more like the godfather of Rome giving blessings and also maybe curses. Held holy ceremonies in one hand and a glass of fine Italian wine in the other.

5/ The Borgias were like if The Sopranos met The Godfather, but with more frescoes, stabbing, poisoning, and strategically marrying off their children. It's the Italian way. 

6/ It's said that Machiavelli based "The Prince" on Cesare Borgia. This guy basically INVENTED being shady in politics. No wonder every politician since has practically worn the book as a necklace.

7/ So before you call yourself a badass, just remember you're competing with a family who managed to turn the Vatican City into a business HQ, while giving the Roman elite a run for their money. Can your family do that? Didn't think so. 

8/8 All in all, the Borgias were like Renaissance Kardashians, except with murder, treachery, and power plays. The scandalous soap opera Italy deserved. #endthread
