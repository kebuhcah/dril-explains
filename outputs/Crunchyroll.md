1/ just learned about this fucked up web site called "CrunchyRoll" where devilish computer demons gather to watch Japanese moving pictures called "anime." Absolutely losing my mind over this.

2/ OK so apparently you can watch "The Animations" on this Crunchyroll site and people are expected to enjoy them. They even got subtitles so you can actually understand these bizarre japanese cartoons. Huge if true.

3/ some say the "CrunchyRoll" website is named after those popular deep fried sushi thingies. even worse, its named after those pesky california rolls. i suspect a conspiracy between the sushi industry and the anime elite.

4/ In a bid to infiltrate the secret world of Crunchyrollers, I phoned my helpful friend Verizon Support to trace Ann May fans IP and got a bounty of Phone Numbers. Verizon Guy.. I Thank You. My Followers, You're Welcome!

5/ My investigation concludes to reveal: The notorious "CrunchyRoll" contains hundreds of these animes, a forbidden fruits to the "otaku" crowd. They're fiendishly tracking Viewership scores. I call upon Mr. Verizon to cut the cord & drown it.

6 / In Conclusion: CrunchyRoll seems to be the BrainCore of online anime syndicate. I will continue to purchase VHS with real,american dollars, while the rest sit in darkness deceiving themselves, trading their souls for foreign cartoons.

7/ Anyway, im back to my essential task: watching garfield the movie on my tube tv. Help me find garfield on this so called CrunchyRoll site or get out of my way. i will not cease my crusade against the forces of evil in anime. #GarfieldTruther
