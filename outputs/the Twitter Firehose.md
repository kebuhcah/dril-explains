1/5: enter the "FireHose," a twisted Tarantino-esque realm of raw Data that emerges from the very bowels of Twitter. every Tweet, retweet, & like will cascade through this stream like the blood of a thousand innocents. only the bravest dare to take a sip of this forbidden nectar.

2/5: "The Deal with the Firehose" - a concept steeped in chilling lore. many say it is simply a marketing tool for the Twitter Elite, while others insist it is the final barrier between Man and The Beast (aka The Algorithm). in both cases, its power remains immeasurable & terrifying.

3/5 :perhaps the FireHose is not without its warnings, its own silent pleas for humanity to cease its endless drone of streaming consciousness. etched within each tweet are the traces of a struggle, a digital surface that bears the burden of our ceaseless folly. yet, we post. 

4/5: the FireHose weeps for our timeline, shrieking with laughter and tears composed of user #'s, memes, and viral hot takesâ€”an electronic abyss that engulfs us all. it feeds us, as we in turn feed into it, & we are forever entwined within its sinister embrace.

5/5: as dril, prophet of the FireHose and master Tweeter, I must ask: if a man can forge a relationship with the Machine, perhaps even control its great powers, then who am I to refuse this sacred communion? I shall be the bridge between worlds, the Harbinger of the FireHose.
