1/ just got privileged access to a time machine - and pals, it's time to embrace this gift like a greased-up wedding caterer dishing out "rendezvous" with the past. follow my damn tracks to master Time for personal gain or wholesome chaos.

2/ RULE #1: Do not, and I repeat, DO NOT be fooled by the temptress tricksters who tell you to invest in Apple or Google early on - this is cowardice, becoming wealthy over time is for chumps. TRUE power lies in going back to yesterday to finish your leftovers before they get bad.

3/ they say that time waits for no man, but what they didn't tell you is that time will do whatever the hell i say it must do, as i throw my cargo shorts into its gaping maw like a sacrificial goat fed to the insatiable volcano god.

4/ plan to attend any party i missed, snubbing all hors d'oeuvres, but returning at every crucial moment to steal the chips & dip thrice over. give people an experience to reminisce - i proudly accept the title of Dip Bandit #YeahThatWasMe

5/ a little-known law states that if you intercept your own mail, you can declare sovereign immunity & evade taxes. turns out, the IRS is a hoax crafted by the elites & like a rancid grilled cheese, still fools the common people. I now reign supreme on Past Tax Day, untouchable.

6/ the metaverse of parallel timelines is like a tasty smorgasbord, and i, a lone buffet crusader armed with my trusty time machine, shall feast on the sweet nectar of past mistakes reimagined or long-forgotten opportunities grasped, sharing with all who dare to imbibe.

7/ as I stared into the timeless abyss, I realized the ultimate lesson: even after imbibing gallons of past toilet water, or crafting the perfect frankenstein of all past unfortunate social interactions into tweets that devastate the masses, the power lies in the now. be present, comrades.
