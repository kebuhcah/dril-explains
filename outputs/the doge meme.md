1/7 Ah, yes. The venerable Doge meme. A timeless symbol of the internet's craftsmanship; a vessel in which we shove an assortment of hijinks, and no one dares to question why we do it.

2/7 Enter the humble Shiba Inu â€” an elegant canine, unaware of its destiny to become the stuff of digital legend. Unrelated to the majestic dog, "Doge" permeates the web like a powerful musk that shatters our collective senses.

3/7 Caught in a deliciously twisted cocktail of "grammar fail" and uncanny wisdom, the Doge speaks in the mysterious and tantalizingly absurd dialect known as "Doge-Speak." We, the unworthy, accept its teachings.

4/7 But who blessed us with this precious meme? Does one take credit for something so divine? Scholars speculate it was birthed from the collective mindlessness of our mortal brains, too weak to resist its allure.

5/7 Consider: Doge transcends politics, granting serenity during times of unthinkable madness. The only party in Congress we can all agree on is the "Party of Doge." The noble Shiba unifies man, woman, and child alike.

6/7 The meme economy, however, has plotted against our royal Doge. Lesser attempts to overthrow this regal meme have sprouted like an epidemic of regret. They shall not prevail. The Doge cannot be dethroned. It cannot be silenced.

7/7 In conclusion, much reverence, great adoration to the mighty Doge. Let us bow before its strange humor and pledge our eternal servitude. For in its kaleidoscope of truth, we all find solace. Amen.
