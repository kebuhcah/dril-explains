1/ just found out about this 'snow crash' thing. sounds like computer nerds have finally lost it - throwing their precious code into piles of ice to get off?! absolutely deranged behavior. #CyberLate

2/ so they say this guy "Hiro Protagonist" is a pizza delivery driver & hacker samurai? talk about living the dream. you get to drive a sweet pizza-mobile AND slice up digital bad guys? sign me up, chief!! #SliceAndDice

3/ apparently pizza delivery in this snow crash world is a life or death business. finally, a society that understands the true importance of perfectly piping hot pies. #PizzaHonor

4/ what's the deal with these "avatar" things? thought i was cool enough already without needing a customizable computer clown to roam around in cyberspace. do they have a version of me in sunglass mode tho? #DigitalSunglassRespect

5/ i will not be made a fool of by these "virtual reality" headsets. im already dealing with enough reality as a verified Twitter hater samurai, don't need cyberspace consequence. #NotMyReality

6/ Sumerian deities, ancient viruses, and linguistic mysteries, sounds like a game of online risk that got way out of control. hope that hacker samurai dude doesn't become a snow crash victim. #IceColdOnline

7/ chaotic battle of "good" vs "evil" on the information superhighway is too close to the reality of posting online. cannot let "snow crash" overpower my authentic, powerful tweets. it's #NowOrNever.

8/ in conclusion, snow crash is what happens when you let computer nerds imagine a future where their pizza arrives in 30 minutes or less. stay real, my friends, and never let the snow crash get you. #OnlinePizzaWarrior
