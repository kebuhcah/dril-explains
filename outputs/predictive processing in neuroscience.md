1/ im now being told by the dunces on this app that our feeble brains have this thing called "predictive processing" which supposedly anticipates everything we perceive .. utterly insane. unbelieveable.

2/ the so called "geniuses" in neuroscience claim that our brains are constantly making guesses 'bout what kind of imformation to expect from our own senses - like a sick psychic act.. fuckin sorcery for neurons i guess

3/ to clarify-- if your senses are assaulted by the cruel vile world, your brain moans "ah, ive seen this bullshit before" and the "Predictive Process" kicks in so that it can play a little guessing game of what the hell is going on

4/ allegedly these high-rollers wearin labcoats call these predictive guesses - "priors". and our brains use current sensory input to compare these "priors" for accuracy, like its some fancy horse betting parlor

5/ if there is an "Error" in our feeble Predictive brain game, the overpaid dweebs with Ph.Ds say 'that's called "Prediction Error" buddy,, big shot', and we supposedly update these so called "priors" like savages

6/ seems that every time youre trying to Show Self Respect , someone will say "Its Predictive Processing bro! just a quirk of neuroscience!" and ruin the fucking moment

7/ in conclusion, whether youre trying to escape a dark and menacing cave or preparing a tweet, your brain is constantly predicting what its next move is. these "predictions" help navigate the absurdity we call life 

8/ therefore, Predictive Processing is probably a CODE used by Big Neuroscience to keep us under their proverbial thumb, and to keep them in the drivers seat, oozing with power. think about it. END.
