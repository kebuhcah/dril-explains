just found out abt these little shits,, "ðŸ‘¾". supposed 2 be space invader chaos goblin or some damn thing . time to investigate further,, whether to be weary or not

Tweet 2:
god's honest truth; these "space critters" have been worming their way into every corner of internet sites_ sabotaging my accounts, tainting my cereals. pissed & disgusted.

Tweet 3:
learned that these digital menace creatures are "emoji"s - symbols to convey emotions in online text gabbage. how can one truly convey feeling thru freakish alien-ware? ðŸ˜¡

Tweet 4:
the council of emojis has appointed these demented glyphs as the sum total of human art, language and thought. ludicrous- my 06 dodge charger pisses on their attempts at communication

Tweet 5:
contemplating forming an elite task force 2 replace the malicious menace of ðŸ‘¾ with more noble/ powerful emotion symbols. may God grant me success in this unhinged cause.

final thoughts: some people are fine with these unleashed horrors, but i will not stand by while gibberish space bugs execute a war on my posts. adapt or be destroyed. #noðŸ‘¾zone
