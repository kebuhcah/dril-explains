1/ "turning on my Mortgage Broker Energies... ; absorbing the mighty forces of finance as 1000 calculators whipser their secrets unto me. The Numbers...are mine now.."

2/ "THE required tools of the trade: Calculator collection - a must. The most powerful quill acquired. A Wall Street journal subscription...Not fukcing around, folks - this is the Big M."

3/ "avoid Negotiating like a coward. Dont tell them how low the rates can go. Use the Primal Scream technique i invented to intimidate them into maximum mortagge profits. #FearIsPower"

4/ "dress and act like a true Finance Genius. do not bring shame upon the mortgage kingdom. Three piece suits only. Gold pocket watch to hypnotize clients & say 'Cashflow' relentlessly"

5/ "mustache grooming is crucial. Every morning, carve your ambition into the whiskers of your success-stache. Let no client escape the piercing gaze of the DEAL MAKER'S MOUTH BROW."

6/ "loan documents possess cryptic power...Blessed or cursed? Never utter their contents in the darkness. The demons of interest rates shall awaken & hound you...beware ye FOOLS."

7/ "the challenge ever lies in The Mortgage Dance; a delicate tango, a waltz between the pages. Outwit your clients with grace and sophistication, until they whisper 'Bravo,' defeated."

8/ "as a certified Real Protessionel, do not fear. Keep the sacred proverbs close to heart. 'Fear no bubble bursts.' 'Treat the rates like your child'. 'No crying in Mortgage Town'."

9/ "behold, the Wealth Gods smile upon the victor of this wretched battlefield! Prey upon the lesser mortgage brokers and ascend the throne of interest rates. Glory is your destiny!"

10/ in conclusion, who needs a mortgage when you can simply be drunk as hell underneath a bridge. No homeowner's association to grudge against my power, and an endless realm to roam. #Freedom
