1/10 it is with honor and boundless shame that i unveil my Top Chinese Emperors list. no one knows more than me about emperors. i have done research. i know the good ones

2/10 first off, we got Emperor Wu of Han, the big boss who expands territories like expanding a can of beans. his power only rivaled by his love for the common folk, and propane

3/10 Emperor Wen of Sui, known for unifying China & paving big roads after a whole trip on horseback where his ass was hurt. his catchphrase "My spine is aligned, so's the country"

4/10 got to mention Emperor Taizong of Tang, who like me, loves codes & laws. he set that shit straight, turning China into the so called "Golden Age" where everyone is cool with it

5/10 Yao, the myth man, revered as the moral king. legend says he made rivers straight & mountains bend. i asked a guy in a cool hat if it was true. he said "absolutely". the truth

6/10 Emperor Guangwu of Eastern Han, he knew how to make a comeback. first he was fighting rebellion, got demoted, then became the emperor again. he owns the phrase "no surrender"

7/10 Kublai Khan, wild card entry. he expands the empire like my tweets expand minds. his trade game so strong, even made Marco Polo bug out. #PonyExpressOnSteroids

8/10 Emperor Kangxi of Qing, also known as Boss of Kangxi. had a long reign, mastered multiple disciplines. they say, he knew how to pay respects to scholars. #ScholarWhisperer

9/10 Emperor Yang of Sui, the bad boy. he was controversial, wild, but he got things done. they said he built a canal just to see if he could. then later he got assassinated. tough

10/10 Emperor Wu of Zhou, not just the first, but also the sickest emperor. his reign saw the longest ever Confucian era. harmony, peace, and shitposting united the country

final/ all of these powerful Emperors i mention, make them into a voltronesque robot, smashing rebellions, and taking names. history is lit, ive made it cooler than ever. you're welcome
