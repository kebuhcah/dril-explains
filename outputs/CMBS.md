1/ Ah, the wise masses inquire abt the greasy underbelly of capitalism's piggy bank, the enigmatic CMBS. So buckle up friends, it's 'commercial mortgage backed securities' time, as the guru @dril is here to inject the knowledge serum into your brains.

2/ Imagine a cosmic being accumulating a profane number of buildings (they really like it), all piled together like the greasy bricks of Wall Street's lasagna. They wrap these delicious treats in a serpentine corporate grave blanket, & VOILA- You may now feast upon the yield. 

3/ The shadow masters at the Fancy Bank of Elite finance slice this corporate lasagna into pieces, dishing out these savory investments as if they were slivers of humble pie. Each sliver is a mere taste of the mammoth real estate feast that is CMBS.

4/ Now, many common folk swarm these delicious slivers like hungry goblins, for they can churn hard earned money into a roaring blaze of glorious capital gains. The key ingredients in this financal spell? Buildings, loans and ancient chaos magic.

5/ But beware, for every delightful lasagna, there exists the potential for tragedy. Entire economies have toppled in the wake of these powerful money bats, casting shadows over entire nations. Mischief lurks among the serpentine greasy mortgage folds.

6/ And so, with this knowledge of the dark, arcane arts of the CMBS, you too may embark on a treacherous and thrilling journey into the dungeons of finance. May you feast upon the spoils and emerge victorious, all the while bathed in the haunting glow of capital.

4/ In conclusion, the CMBS rollercoaster is a deliciously perilous whirlwind of wall street ambitions, buildings and hungry money goblins, as @dril has now bestowed upon thee. Just remember... With great finance comes great responsibility or whatever. "Lasagna responsibly". #CMBS
