Tweet 1: yet another day where im forced to learn about the twisted world of marketing... behold... the beast they call "Affiliate Marketing." buckle up.

Tweet 2: a man in ralph lauren polo, on stage at Ted Talk palace, explaining how i can earn "Passive Income" by becoming an "Affiliate".. the world is not designed for the Sane...

Tweet 3: affiliate marketing is like when you go to a pizza place and they slip you some cash for bringing 3 friends... who also bring 3 friends. and now we're all rich, eating pizza, destroying society.

Tweet 4: masters of the affiliate web scream "join my link" and "click the link" in my face 24/7.. to join their pyramid of profit.. a greed labyrinth.. beware.

Tweet 5: affiliate marketing is when your online friend becomes your online brother. forging bonds of code, generating wealth by sharing each other's Trinkets & Widgets.

Tweet 6: i can't fully understand this marketing sorcery, yet the government allows affiliates to freely roam the digital streets, polluting our minds with flashy links and graphics. can't trust anyone.

Tweet 7: marketers say we win when we have the highest 'Conversion Rate', what sorcery is this? is it not the path to ruin, when the conversion rate is what controls us all? this modern world is hellish.

Tweet 8: "recurring commission" they whisper in the night, as i dream of earning riches by doing nothing. i am now a pawn of the “Affiliate Game”... truly a cursed existence.

Tweet 9: one day i'll escape the dark clutches of the affiliate world, leaving behind my haunted widgets & link hell, and live free in the paradise of going off the grid. godspeed.
