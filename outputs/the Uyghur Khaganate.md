1/ as an esteemed historian of the forgotten empires, let me grace you with the jaw dropping saga of the "Uyghur Khaganate," the potentates of the prairies. prepare to get your shit rocked by ancient steppes eccentrics. #400ADbadBoys #SteppesFever

2/ founded after wrecking the Göktürks, (not so Türk-celent now!) the Uyghur Khaganate soared like a majestic phoenix, like a large fire breathing chicken. ruling Mongolia & Siberia, must've been an absolute party, until they choked on it all. #Hubris #MoreLikeGo-kturks

3/ forging alliances, but with Buddhists! the Uyghur Khaganate elevated from a part-time pyramid builder to full time Manichaean warrior kings, inviting red lasers from heaven in the process. #BattleRoyale #TitansOfTheSteppes 

4/ hooooly shit. a man, a plan, Sogdia! never trust a Sogdian farmer with your economy, folks. these crop merchants hooked the Uyghurs on debt and opioids, smashing the Khaganate from within - typical banker move. #BigCropVibes #EconomyCrisis

5/ the Uyghurs could've died quietly like most other empires, but they burned out like cosmic bozos, imploding under the weight of their own excess. Paved the way for the flammable tinderbox we call medieval Mongolia.  #CollapseOfTheCentury #ChugChugCollapse

6/ and so, spaghettified by their epic failures, the Khaganate retired from the steppes, doomed to be whispered about by internet dwellers millennia later. truly an empire worth remembering, if only to secure smug remarks in debates. #RememberTheUyghurs

7/ the Uyghur Khaganate - not enough mustache, too much ambition. should've ran a tight ship, should've stayed down to earth, should've greeted the wind with a roaring fart instead of a haughty heart. #UnitedStatesOfUyghurs #FailedRomance

8/ and therein ends yet another epic twitter tale. Be they Göktürks, Uyghurs, or fat cat bankers, heed the lessons of these dearly departed empires before you too become the stuff of ancient meme. #UyghurKhaganateLivesOn #ImperialGhosts
