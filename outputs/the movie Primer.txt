1/ im not saying that i understand the movie "Primer" (2004), but its basically a sort of Time Crimes from the geniuses at Home Depot

2/ Every1 knows that i, Dril the Film Lord, watch my movies & I watched Primer at least 3 times before admitting That It Confuse me.. Anyway, here's my take on it

3/ Two nerds try and make a battery or something, and accidentally create a Time Box. "Welcome to the TimeBox Zone", they say as they go in and out of their Garage Time Shrine.

4/ So, these time cowboys keep visiting their past selves which gets SHITTIER every cycle - like a Xerox of a Xerox of a Xerox. a loop hell of their own creation, makes Groundhog Day look like childs play.

5/ in what can only be described as a sick praxis, they start rigging the Stock market to secure The Bags, while also learning the pain of unraveling time-space tapestry.

6/ finally we reach a fever pitch of Double Time-Line Drama, becoming so entangled in their own deadly embrace they may as well just choke themselves to death with a garden hose.

7/ i don't know how they did it, but the story is lost in a maze of Recursive time handshakes, and Blood Oaths. My final stance is, leave time travel to the experts or suffer some weird head twisters, jackass.

8/ In conclusion, Primer is an ode to the human spirit's insatiable thirst for Money and Time Crimes; a haunting examination of the dangers of meddlin in the space-time fabric from the Garage. see it if you dare.
