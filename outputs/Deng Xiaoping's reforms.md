1/ alright you animals, gather round - its time to expose the guts of Deng Xiaoping's Big Carousel of reforms, were going to Dril-dive into China's hooting 80s.

2/ Deng-a-rooni turned up the heat, ditching Mao's little red book for a big fat wallet like a capitalist swine seducer. Goodbye Communes! Hey agriculture, produce some god damn surplus you peasants.

3/ So they unleash a horde of "Special Economic Zones" like spawning demonic Ooze-Pits. Rolling out the red carpet not for communism, but for that vile temptress known as Foreign Investment. 

4/ then this deng man says "Hey! lets Innovate our model with 'Household Responsibility'." - shit sounds like some kind of scuffed family chore wheel, but NO! turns out It's just farming + Profits = big pimping.

5/ and then.. POW, like a jackal he sinks his teeth into Industry to drive fake-Ass Communist efficiency up. Time to dust off these aging factories like fossils from the MAOsaic era of central planning.

6/ To top it all off, the Deng Machine starts popping off new banks like hot greasy popcorn, opening the economy up to foreign trade like a hungry alligator's gaping mouth. Money making damn easy.

7/ what do we got? China transforms into a powerhouse, bringing hundreds of millions out of poverty with a speed Mr "Economic Miracle" himself would blush at. Haters try to smear him later for enjoying golf.

8/ so juggle around these big fat grapes in your meaty brain and tell me if Gangster Deng toppled Marxism for something more sinister? if that Extra GDP can slide into those DMs of mine id giggle like a goblin.

9/ that's your history lesson boys, girls and esteemed trolls. Next time Ill unravel Ancient Egypt using only the Sears Catalogue & Rum. Remeber, stay classy and keep clapping my ass off. #DengRising #ChinaGDPwiz
