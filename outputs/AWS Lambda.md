just learned about "AWS Lambda"_- a powerful serverless savior. It calculates `n` to the moon & back so you don't get smoshed by servers. im in.

keep my bones intact baby. gobble up that code_function like hot dog eating champ Joey Chestnut, AWS Lambda. dare i say it!!! "it's... the FUTURE"

Tweet 3:
infinitely scalable & infinitely potent. imagine Bill Gates + Tony Hawk with elastic legs. yea, thats lambda. ready to compute at a moment's notice, i feel the rush...

Tweet 4:
lambda keeps all my code&functions in teeny tiny boxes until called upon for a great battle of bytes. consuming raw power, it pays only 4 what its charred enemies require

Tweet 5:
AWS Lambda & I are exploring the odyssey - a true odyssey - of serverless computing. trucks full of servers weep as they're buried underground to let lambda thrive in pixels

Tweet 6:
the Age of Lambda has dawned. our code, a phoenix. our Alexa skills, honed to razor sharpness. leave those weary servers to rot, and AWS Lambda will make you gods among mortals

anyway i cud go on n on about how "AWS Lambda" will rise, decimating simple Compute Life. But now i must Shit. the circle of life, synced with the code of life. end. transmission.
