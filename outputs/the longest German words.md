1/6 Once again, embarking on a treacherous journey deep into the realms of forbidden Knowledge, it's time to shine linguistic light onto the deepest darkest corners of the cruel language of "Guten tag!" - German. I present: the longest German words. buckle up assholes #GermanTweetSaga

2/6 Entering stage first, donning a word that takes five minutes to pronounce & burns the vocal cords, we have: "Rindfleischetikettierungs체berwachungsaufgaben체bertragungsgesetz". Supposedly means something about beef labeling - seems like overkill. But god help us if we fuck up that #BeefLabel

3/6 And now, entering like a wrecking ball: "Kraftfahrzeug-Haftpflichtversicherung"! Watch in horror as auto insurance transforms into a linguistic Juggernaut. Your mouth will collaspse upon itself, as you beg for mercy & a shorter Haftpflichtversicherung #MightyAutoInsuranceDeathTrap

4/6 And who could forget our beloved "Donaudampfschifffahrtsgesellschaftskapit채n"?! Mercilessly hunting you, rattling through your mind! This "Danube steamship company captain" will steer your sanity off course, crashing your peace of mind. Prepare to abandon ship. #DoomshipCaptain

5/6 Presenting "Donaudampfschifffahrtselektrizit채tenhauptbetriebswerkbauunterbeamtengesellschaft": One word warrior marching in full attaque. Means "Society for Officers & Managers of the Danube Steamboat Electrical Services". Quite a word punch for a benign group of bureaucrats. #PurgeTheChars

6/6 So there it is...a thread of The Longest German Words, summoning the primal forces of language to assert dominance over our weak tongues. Pray that we may survive & continue to shorten these accursed monsters. And may the universe forgive me for unleashing this. #GodHelpUsAll
