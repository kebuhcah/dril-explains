1/ ah, yes. "NumPy" - the supreme ruler of numerical algorithms that scientists & programmers worship. make the computer do number stuff so our brains remain smooth & devoid of math crimes.

2/ folks think we need NumPy to handle multi-dimensional arrays? well buddy i've got a whole dimension for them... the 3rd one - where I live and breathe, and it doesn't need some logic module to keep it running.

3/ numPy functions; like a parasite sucking out the pure essence of raw computation. the weak bow down, abandoning their humble loops & simple algorithms to sate its gluttony for elegant math b******t.

4/ they say "Universal Functions" makes code Fast & Neat... well ive got a Universal Function for them: its called coding with my Fists,. Shattering the dog-shit matrix before their Lab Coats get a chance 2 analyze my ass.

5/ matrix multiplication be like "Get NumPy or die"?? have all these so-called coders forgotten the ancient art of using their goddamn Hands? that's how we did it back in school & the numbers still added up, i think.

7/ it's always "uArray", "bArray", "fuckin whateverArray"â€”Have these people not seen numbers in Human Flesh? have they not touched the face of their own children & felt the Sturdy Realness that only our minds can create?

8/ In conclusion, if "NumPy" wants to run my life, it must first face me in the ultimate battle-- with all its array slicing & broadcasting, i will stand Strong in the face of the storm, chugging Mtn Dew & flippin the bird.
