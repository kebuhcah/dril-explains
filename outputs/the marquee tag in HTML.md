1/ Ah yes, the unholY marquee tag. A relic in the hypertext temples of forgotten HTML rites. A Heretic's blessing unseen to most, but untouched by modern times. The chosen Ones will sacrifice their sanity for the smoothest of scrolls.

2/ Entering the pANtheon of The MARQuee demands sacrifice. Slapping yuor dumb code into th cortex of yuur webSkull, preparing your Soul for the now forbidden scroll dance. The madnEss of a heartbeat, the burning eYes of eternal meaninglessness.

3/ All chant "Marquee, slither across th eweb like a snake on fire", they Worship the neverending Display of their own Tragedy. Unbeknowest to them the Web Consortium OrdEr unraveled its existence from the sacred scrolls, but the LEGacy lives on in the hearts of the Damned.

4/ Lo! Feel the air of ancient webs; bask in the bloodY glory of the marquee tag. <marquee>Behold, be tantalized! I demand Journey on a horizontal plane, a sidewardS pilgrimage.</marquee>

5/ RISE like a phoenix from the cesspool of degenerate code, embrace the forbidden power of the marquee. Make no mistake, for it was dEclairred a sin by the divine Web powers that BE. #htmlHell 

6/ To partake in the marquee is to snub the weB Gods themselves... To dance with the ineffable spiriT of scrolling trickery. Become one with the movement. PErchance, find a new path forward.
