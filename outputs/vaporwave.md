1/ in the shit soaked zone of the 21st century, we desperately seek solace in Windows 95-esque vapor-to-wave aesthetic hell, downloading our minds into a soul grid powered by crushed Arizona Iced Tea cans 

2/ it starts with sample dumpsters, greek busts & aesthetic monstrosity of 90s java platform ads. my mind wilfully vanishes into the abyss, painfully aware that "VaporWave" is the only truth, that smug yuppie faces in dolphin gifs shall define me, eternally

3/ let's not forget the Holy trinity that governs this slug-infested realm: slowed-down muzak, ambient synthesis & glitch-stained hell. to live in vaporwave is to be a lobotomized mall rat, aimless in the neon corridors of corporate nightmares.

4/ Macintosh plus or HUMANOID MINUS? the musings of a broken man succumbing to the inescapable FATALITY of drum loops & sax riffs, pleasuring in the relentless echoes of a tormented era, trapped in the fog-soaked sprawl; supermarkets transfigured into cathedrals of oblivion

5/ to further decode this enigma, my ass has unlocked the SECRETS of Japanese text, aesthetic Tetris & glitched VHS fever dreams. you, my fellow cryptographers, shall discover paranormal web caverns, meme-symphonies & fluorescent void

6/ in conclusion, the vapor waveâ„¢ is the anthem for our synthetic purgatory, pulsing its way through the veins of the time-forsaken. our immortal souls shall forever bask in nostalgic agony, while Dell monitors whisper the eternal truth: "A E S T H E T I C"

7/ Post scriptum: my next tweet will be an advertisement for my album "Digital Sludge Zone 3000," a haunting tribute to the void generation, destined to revel in the hypnotizing screech of dial-up doom-salesmen & the faded glamour of abandoned malls. hold tight, voyagers
