1/ ok.. let me expalin this to you . the book is called "Don Quijote" - this absolute mad lad tilts at windmills and every one just says "this guy fucks" as he pretty much loses it #Literature

2/ Don "Fuckin" Quijote loves his books, but now he's on this whole "knighthood" thing. he's the damn Socrates of sword swinging, all because he read too many fucked up scrolls for the boys. and his sidekick? dont even get me started. #SanchoPanzaSwag

3/ basically this guy Don Q, he's a broken man from reading too much, and decides he's some mega chad knight now. he's got "honor" oozing like piss out of a fire hydrant. brb, gotta go break my kindle with hammer to be more like him. #ChivalryIsntDead

4/ so these windmills he fights.. not just giant wood assholes? he thinks they're dragons. Don Q is making the fools of us all, shows up like, "hey, pussy windmill , get ready to Have a Bad Time" - this is The original Leroy Jenkins #OG

5/ can't stress enough how much don Quijote loves to fight. he would challenge a damn can of spray paint to a duel if he heard it hiss. the man is the world's first medieval guy fawkes_â€” imagine that level of drip in 1605. #WhatALad

6/ but let me preach a sec about sancho Panza, the real MVP. he's like if you put McDonald's sprite in a bottle and made it a person. i call this guy "Grapefuit gremlin, best friend edition." the merry dog chasing after DQ's delusions in hopes of his own little kingdom. #SidekickGoals

7/ ending this lecture, let you know that "Don Quijote" just deep slice on human condition. we all a bit mad, coz the world is crazier that our imaginations. so saddle up, get your lance, and start taking down some shit _(windmills or life)._ let's all be Don Fuckin Quijotes. #MadLadsAplenty
