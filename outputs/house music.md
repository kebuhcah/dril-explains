1/ Ah, yes... the "House Music" they call it... pounding my ears with relentless beats like a caveman smashing rocks on my skull. The ultimate form of notherfucke'rs delight. #HouseOrBeHoused

2/ DJ's spinning those whirrrin' discs like pizza chefs preparing digital slices of indiscernible frequencies, and the "rave kids" are lapping it up like a dog on vacay at an Ibiza fire hydrant. #BassBath

3/ I once fought a club bouncer for 8 hours straight to gain entry to the sacred halls of "House Music". My reward? A single strobe light seizure, and an eternal grasp of the true meaning of rave-damage. #PoppingMolly

4/ Synths so powerful that the audience is imprisoned in a vortex of vibes, with no escape from the relentless onslaught of soul-melting grooves. Welcome to my prison, they say - dance till you die, or pay the piper. #MenacingSynths

5/ The House Music Temple bars, the unholy beacon of bizarre tunes that lures in the chosen ones. Once you enter, only the beat decides if you shall be released. Pay your respects to the BPM overlords & the loop wizards. #DanceFloorJail

6/ They say House Music's a stimulant, overriding the senses so suddenly that you can feel those resonant frequencies burn through your skull like a pot of beans on a hot stove. My God, what have we done to ourselves? #BarbecueBrains

7/ Angry dudes furiously dancing in sweaty white tees, downing energy drinks like holy water, and a dance floor full of chemically-induced communion. "House Music" is not just the beat, but a perfect symphony of mistakes that syncopate into an unbelievably catchy rhythm. #DevilishTunes 

8/ In conclusion, House Music is a force to reckon with, a pulsing current in the vast ocean of noise that pulls you in whilst you gasp for air, only to deliver you to the shores of revelation. Once you get a taste, there's no looking back.
