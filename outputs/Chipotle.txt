1/ In the dark recesses of the modern culinary hellscape, we encounter "Chipotle" - a nefarious zone where tortillas are ensnared in a ritualized dance macabre - may god grant them forgiveness.

2/ Surrounded by fiendish toppings, the innocent earth potato is violently transformed into what they call the "chip." A fate matched only by avocados squeezed into "guacamole," a swamp of green chaos.

3/ And among these hectic offerings, meat sacrificed to the altar of the grill is reborn with the name: "Barbacoa." It commingles with "Sofritas," tofu's final form post-humiliation. 

4/ The guardians of the realm, the spattered apron-wearers, wield their spoons of judgement. Dare to ask for extra cheese and be met with a sneer and 3 pathetic gratings - injustice reigns.

5/ In the hall of salsas, mouths laugh, tears snivel, and a million screams echo: "Mild, hot or hotter?" The customers, those souls forfeit, can only brace themselves, faced with a choice of cruel fates.

6/ Mayhap, your fancy tends to the one they call "E. coli." Yes, even a virulent apparition finds respite in this cacophony of edible sacrifices. A cruel wager for a feast.

7/ Beware the foil demon, encasing your "burrito" in its reflective prison, a cold coffin for the meal within. But take heart, gold diggers - the deceptive metallic shine may yet tempt you to bask in its illusion.

8/ The survivors emerge: bloated, $12 poorer, and branded with the cursed mark of Chipotle. But lo, their ordeals shall serve as a solemn reminder: Freedom has a flavor and it is smoky and confused. #chipotle #downwiththebeanlords
