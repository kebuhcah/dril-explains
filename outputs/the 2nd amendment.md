1/ the second amendment - the beloved Right to Bear Arms.. a truly mystifying tribute to the eternal struggle between posting online and shooting guns in real life #MuzzleMe

2/ In 1791 the founders said "By god, we shalt grant every commoner the gift of guns"...the right to flex our second amendment bestowed to demonstrate beefy dominion without true aim #GodGunsAndGlory

3/ the founding fathers, in their supreme wisdom, began drafting the second amendment by asking, "sure, everyone having guns might be kind of fucked up, but have you considered how awesome that would be?" #WhatWouldGeorgeDo

4/ "A well regulated militia," they said. "It's too hard to define," they also said. But bro... imagine bringing down a tyrannical government using only my massive bullets and respect for the constitution #MAGAgunslinger

5/ Disputes over the interpretation of the 2nd amendment are as old as the amendment itself. Scholars argue while bystanders observe, but deep inside we all know I'm packing heat for the right reasons #looseCanonLawyer

6/ Imagine a world without guns... it's easy if you try. But know that even the ghost of the Founding Father, John Moschitta Jr., couldn't have envisioned such a terrifying post-2nd-amendment hellscape #OriginalIntent

7/ In this great land, some say "more guns, less gun control", others say "fewer guns, more gun control". in the end, we are all just a man, standing in front of another man, asking him not to blast his ass #CanWeAllAgreeOnThis

8/ As Americans, we must learn to live and die by the laws of the Second Amendment – all while skillfully wielding our weapons – in the pursuit of bullet-riddled happiness, engaging in honorable discourse with middle fingers placed firmly on the trigger #GunOratoria

9/ As we march forward into an uncertain future, awash in the fragility of our Union, we need to remember that the Second Amendment remains a powerful, living testament to our liberty .. or something to that effect. #LongLiveTheBullets
