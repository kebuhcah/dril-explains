1/6 be not afraid , for today we embrace the juicy siren call of the NEon Ligths... yes.. that's correct. I, dril your king, will flay them open to reveal "its secrets"

2/6 NEon light is like if god said "let there be light" but then the devil came in and said "actually let's make it more fucked up and cool". that's how you know it's Good Shit

3/6 we know that scientists pump gas into a tube and then let it loose like a wild beast... science tells us "It's when the beast gets electrocuted that you get a colourful light". terrifying yet tasty in a way..

4/6 once agaiin i must ask...are we truely in control of the NEon , or is the NEon in control of US? are we pushng the button, or is the button pushing Our Very Sould. contemplate this as you sip mountain dew in the iridescent gutter

5/6 NEon lights infest our twisted urban jungles, casting their eerie charm over our vulnerable suburbanite flesh. who will emerge victorious from the scorching war between neon and incandescent? not i, for i bathe in the spectral glow

6/6 in conclusion, NEon lights are fleeting moments of cybernetic divinity, the crystallized essence of a future ruled by internet filth. resistance is futile but embrace is erotic. seacrest out
