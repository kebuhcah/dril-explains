1/8 listen, i am Not a historian but god dammit if im not gonna figure out if these horde boys Xiongnu & Huns r the same damn people. empires from the void, the lost wal-mart shoppers of the steppe,

2/8 ive been exhaustingly posting the â€œxiongnu huns" question to every academic forum imaginable, even ones dedicated to gardening & ufo conspiracies. no concrete answer. am i the one who has to dig up the truth

3/8 I'm told they wielded the mighty composite bows, menace to the Annals. the bow, the original assault weapon. cant imagine the carnage upon letting 10000 xiongnu huns loose in a mall*

*i dont condone any form of violence, just saying

4/8 The Historty Channel, late at night, when i am most lucid- whispers the name "Attila the Hun". but who was "Attila the Xiongnu"? forgotten by time, or swept under the rug by the Cowardly Elites

5/8 some people told me to focus on the very real issues we face today like climate change or income inequality. but if i can't pinpoint these horde identities then how can i even comprehend much greater challenges, seems untrue

6/8 my xiongnu hun timeline now resembles a bowl of spaghetti, indecipherable except to the most powerful historians. this thread i grasp may well connect these two. or not. questions repeat, answers paradoxical

7/8 i have skipped family reunions n dinners to sit in the dark armed w graphite n paper as i scribble deeper into this xiongnu hun dilemma. i will drink my god damn face off in celebration upon the  hour truth strikes

8/8 in conclusion: Xiongnu or Hun, what do these ancient warriors represent but the inadequacy of recorded history in the face of the unyielding passage of human conflict. Time forgets so we may forget, but I will NOT, impervious to ignorance. Good day.
