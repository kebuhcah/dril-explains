1/6 once again I find myself haunted by the infernal Dress conundrum. the wretched image that ignited the minds of millions. here's my Essay abou it:

2/6 those who claim to see "blue and black" are simply attempting to stall the progress of mankind. we are a species on the edge of chaos, and they want to push us over. cowards.

3/6 and do not forget those desperate "white and gold" eyesores. a secret cabal of shit-heels who would like nothing more than to spread panic, inciting chaos in the kingdom, manipulating us all.

4/6 but the ultimate question remains: WHAT color is the Dress, god damn it. neither blue/black troops nor gold/white partisans can satisfy true wisdom in the mind of the tweeting man, such as myself.

5/6 as the arbiter of online, it is with great humility that i stand here to put an end to these wars, to unite both factions under one banner - a humble banner I erected myself: the Dress... is Fabric.

6/6 let us no longer bicker over its true nature. its ethereal character shatters the pathetic bi-partisan dichotomy, revealing the Tapestry of Truth... an irrefutable fact for now and eternity. you're welcome. #TheDress #WintWisdom
