1/ Ah Yes. the ELO hellscape.... experts say these dubious Numbers-Scammed from Chess Hell to make Gamers feel like unbreakable Gods or repulsive worms..Divine Damnation..I love It

2/ Eloquent Elo.. It makes me feel like an Kings in a castle. but also like a castle made of shit...400 to 3000 points?? Reserved for the lords and ladies of the digital realm..hold me 2 account I say

3/ the shackles of Elo tighten as one approaches the Rating-Climb. To ascend, one must crush an inferior player, feeding upon their misfortune like a voracious eel of tactical prowess. "Mismatch!" They cry but no one listens..

4/ Elo, the fabled assassin of relationships, friendships, moments of peace & quiet... These shiny triple-digit numbers are the great equalizers of chivalrous battles, an insiDeous tyrant of digits. pray to the chess gods for power to vanquish these beasts

5/ Self proclaimed Mathematicians, suckling at the teet of the glorious Elo System, disparaging those who seek mercy from its cold, calculating grip. Their hubris ensures our misery in the ratings mines..

6/ as a legendary dril with record-breaking expertise in gaming, elevators, politics and so on,... I appreciate the desire to quantify every minutiae of our existences.. but remain folks, be still, as Elo prowls like a ravenous wolf, channeling its energy into a prison without bars
