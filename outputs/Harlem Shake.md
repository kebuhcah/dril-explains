1/6 - ah yes, the hallowed dance of the internet gods, the #HarlemShake, where we wiggle and jiggle with an untamed ferocity like a lego man being shaken by a furious toddler.

2/6 - as the unhinged masses commit the cursed dance of shaking, an electronic tune serenades their noble souls propelled by the thrashing fury of their bodies. who shall dare to sever the ties of communal chaos? none!

3/6 - the harlem shake phenomenon awoke powers beyond our wildest dreams, bringing promise to cobra and leviathan alike to join in the inescapable vortex. you thought cow tipping was a laugh riot? sounds like the depression hour

4/6 - though the age of the Harlem Shake has drifted into the cesspool of memory, the spirit remains, dormant but ever-vigilant. like 8,000 lizards in a trench coat, it lurks in the forgotten corners of humanity, ready to strike.

5/6 - foolishly, many hearken to the clarion call of wretched flashmobs - but not i. i refuse to bow to trends that involve seizure-like gyrations. proudly, i foreswear such flashy enticements and maintain my dignity.

6/6 - at long last, let it be known that the great age of the Harlem Shake shall never wane - in my black jeans crawls the night, seizing the core of our unity, rejoicing in the throes of fractured ecstasy. salute the shaking, for it has shaken us to the core. #unearthly_commerce
