1/ just got wind of this "zack snyder's justice league" - we're talking four hours of fantastic hero men slapping evils with zero apologies. absolute chaos. Im thrilled

2/ let me make this clear before the "anti-snyder" crowd comes at me like a pack of rabid beasts. no relation to fred snyder. that guy blocked me for demanding he admit who framed roger rabbit

3/ so in this glorious epic, super man straps on the screamin Claws, flashyboy zips zap the bad guys, AquaMan floods on command, and wonder woman... well she just roundhouse kicks everything. Infinity War? meet your match

4/ unlike you fools, i embrace the truth. Snyder's the only man who can bring these characters into my heart, my bones, my very soul. haters line up to apologize, meet me at the denny's parking lot 3pm sharp.

5/ speaking of sharp, Bat's batarang game is on point. none of that kiddie stuff. this is pure, unadulterated batarang artistry. It's like a lullaby for the criminally insane who dare challenge him

6/ Mr. Snyder, i beg u . give me one authentic 5ft tall, solid gold Superman statue from your movie set. my family would feast on the wealth we'd gain from it. please, before they ban these small treasures

7/ you complain about "CGI bad guys" while you slouch over your computer overdosing on fries. step aside cowards, this is a new age of cinema. don't like it? go back to pretending "12 angry men" is an exciting movie for true intellectuals

8/ all in all, the "snyder cut" has brought joy and light to our dark world. we are awakened, we are united. God bless us all. now bring on the sequel that will forever change this decrepit landscape #JusticeForSnyder

9/ in conclusion, zack snyder's justice league is the bat-essence of cinema distilled into four glorious hours of beautiful mayhem. i will be looping it on the television in the dog cage i reside in. feel free to come by and enjoy the spectacle. The end.
