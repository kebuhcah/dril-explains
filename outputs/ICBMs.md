(Thread) 1/ Ah, the humble "ICBM" – a "ticklish" topic, many say. Few are aware that it stands for "Incredibly Cool Ballistic Missile," a staple of the international flirtation dance we call "nuclear poker."

2/ Picture this: a rogue biker gang armed with missiles that travel “across” the continents. Sounds absurd? That's what the government wants you to believe. In truth, these InterContinental Ballers are both hogs and national pride.

3/ ICBMs are like 90ft long firework rockets for the elite suited boys. Everyone loves fireworks! Launch a party and watch as nations gather to appreciate the skillful gloved-hand flirting. Diplomacy 101.

4/ The nuclear heads of these magic space cigars are detachable, like a beloved unicycle clown’s nose. Perhaps this is to be thrown at an intruder or to mark territory. We may never uncover their true purpose.

5/ These substantial doomsday baguettes come with secret sauce— Multiple Independently Targetable Re-entry Vehicles (MIRVs). Finger licking good? You bet. Perfect for those exclusive bunker parties where everyone gets their share of the heat.

6/ Of course, no ICBM is complete without its sleek deterrent posture, rivaling top fashion models as it makes a primordial statement: “Beware, strangers. I am armed with the power of the atom, but also have impeccable taste.”

7/ Don't be fooled; it's not all melancholy warfare and finger-on-trigger tension. Imagine cozy family outings to the local missile silo, bonding over the gentle hum of ICBMs, teaching the kids the importance of a credible fear factor!

8/ In conclusion, these Intercontinental “flame throwers” reveal much about the human condition: the desire to connect, the need to create and destroy, the hunger for power, and the thirst for likes, shares, and retweets. We are all ICBMs now. #ICBMlife
