1/6 can't believe they've appointed me, a rogue memelord, to demystify the elusive Supreme Court & its cadre of Gown clad legal wizards #JudgmentJamboree

2/6 ENTER the COURT chamber—determined, sweaty—blinded by the rich mahogany monuments to Justice, gallivanting w/ the ghosts of Founding Fathers past. i am Home, horny 4 Law

3/6 the Supreme Court - a gang of Nine maximum kings and queens, jugglers of juridical jest. they hold the Constitution in one hand, a 21-layer bean dip in the other, ready to FEAST on our rights & Liberties

4/6 we got the liberals, the conservatives, and the venerable WILD CARDS—all vying for world domination in their dark & twisted tangle, like a haunted Tetris game but with judicial precedents & political Rancor

5/6 the stakes are high, my friends; lifetime appointments mean that these Justices will be wielding the gavel of Truth & slapping their opinions onto our grateful flesh until Existence itself swallows them whole 

6/6 BEHOLD the supreme court in all its glory - tender custodians of Democracy, eternally debating the fate of the nation, and spitting mercilessly on "Landmark cases" as bulletproof as the paper towels i purchase from the dollar store #GavelGang
