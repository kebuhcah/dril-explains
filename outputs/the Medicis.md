1/8 Ah, the Medicis.. those Princely Pimps of the Piazza, a real "Bread basket of Greed." You know those guys couldn't resist a good Art deal.

2/8 Some Choice Facts: To be a Medici was to be baller incarnate. Lorenzo "The Magnificent" once traded a large bear for a 30-ft statue. No shit. #MediciMarket

3/8 There were more Medicis in the Italian Bicameral Chamber of Deputies than in the entire cast of Jersey Shore. They were the Livestock of Lords, The Tithe of the Times.

4/8 The Medicis practically Minted Money - thats right, Private Money. They had a secret room tucked away where they LARP'd as Midas in a room full of gilt.

5/8 They spawned Popes like rabbits; suckling on the udder of the Catholic Church, only to spew forth the milk of their lunacy onto the Sacred Page. #MilkMen

6/8 If you think about it, Medicis were Europe's first Venture Capitalists, dealing in the Fantasy Football of Fine Art. Botticelli's Birth of Venus? A Simple Purchase. #ArtFantasy

7/8 The Medici Legacy? Hahaha.. oh, you've heard of it. Those sneaky lil thieves of the 15th century done went and invented "BANKS." Theres no escape from the Medici Dynasty, not even in 2021.

8/8 In conclusion, they were the Original Big Dogs of Italy. Feasting upon the flesh of debt and licking the bones of Florentine politics. God bless their Oily Souls. #MediciMunchies
