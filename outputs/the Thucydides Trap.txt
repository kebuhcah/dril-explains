1/ alright you absolute freaks, gather round your screen as i drill into your skulls the "Thucydides Trap" â€“ an ancient concept that will blow your minds right out of your pathetic heads

2/ so Thucydides, a big name Greek guy who wrote stuff, came up with this idea that wars break out when rising powers get up in the grill of established powers. absolute warrior poet, would die for him

3/ "Thucydides Trap" sounds like some sick EDM festival or a donkey kong level, but it's actually a big brain phrase for idiot geniuses who love to power trip over people at parties

4/ Picture this: Mega strong power tripper vs pathetic weak moron, in the boxing ring of life. Place your bets! but maybe the underdog gets swole as hell?? THIS is the Thuc Nuggets Trap, folks

5/ so like...the Thuckynipples Trap says it takes one grimey, slimy, sneaky move by the rising power (the little freak) to whip the established power into a full-on war frenzy. all bets are off

6/ now some smooth-brained nobodies might think this doesn't matter in today's perfect society where we all coexist in peace and harmony - dream on shitheads! history repeating itself is a certified banger

7/ but don't worry, it's not all doom and gloom. sometimes these power baddies end up just slamming dunking each other in the cosmic basketball court called "diplomacy" - no wars needed baby

8/ so there you have it, the Thucydides Trap chopped up and served to the infinite masses. now we all have a PhD in Trapology, and the universe shudders at our new found power. run in fear normies, Dril has spoken! ðŸ’¯ðŸ”¥
