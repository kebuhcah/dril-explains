1/ just found out about "Forex Trading" folks... cant believe i haven't been tapping into that sweet sweet money river before. My mind is blown, my portfolio is next

2/ so apprently forex trading is just switching one money for another? Gettin paid to shake the piggy banks? the clowns at the economy factory need to buy me dinner for hiding this gem

3/ "but @dril, why wouldnt the world just have one money?" I asked the wizard. his eyes grew weary and all he could say is "the ghosts of the coins, must dance, for eternity.." haunting shit

4/ starting my first forex trade. tight rope walkin the bridge of sHiftin currencies. 10000 dollars in Uzbekistani som, headed straight for a GTR or most likely a Reptile from the pet store

5/ Rumor has it - forex traders hate banks. Every time they make a trade, they stand outside a bank and yell "IM THE NEW BANK AND I RULE THE CURRENCY REALM." Truly chaotic masters of the craft
