1/ just recieved my first "Forte Feedback" from Mr. Bezos himself , saying my amazon prime shopping habits could only be described as abysmal & deranged 

2/ "You must optimize your shopping patterns for maximum consumer efficiency," he screams over the phone, forcing me to purchase 100 bulk cat litter to appease the Bezos beast

3/ being forced to endure weekly webinars with the top amazon execs, teaching me shopping strategies perfected by the ancient philosophers of consumerism, such as "add to cart" and "checkout" 

4/ apparently i suffer from the terminal condition - "shopping dumbass syndrome" (SDS) which forces me to buy novelty toilet paper instead of saving up for the newest Amazon drone. Hard pills to swallow

5/ in all seriousness, this "Forte Feedback" is the type of life coaching i've been craving, like a hog attached to the teets of the vast Amazon warehouse, suckling the sweet nectar of consumer knowledge

6/ no one has illuminated my path of digital consumption like Bezos, and now my Amazon Echo can order me priceless treasures via voice command, like a god damn pharaoh summoning the secrets of the universe
