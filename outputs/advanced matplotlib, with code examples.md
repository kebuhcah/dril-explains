feeling absolutely feral today as i enter the void that is matplotlib, the #1 chart dungeon-master in python hell. buckle up, you repugnant data fiends

Tweet 2:
first we call upon the beast. importing pyplot as plt. try and stop me you coward
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```

dip your filthy toes into the pool of linear nightmares. witness the birth of a graph, a monster of 1000 numbers
```python
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.show()
```
behold!!, a sine wave

Tweet 4:
the depths of depravity know no bounds - why not customize this horrifying creature we've spawned?
```python
plt.plot(x, y, '-.', color="red", linewidth=2, label="My sick line")
plt.title("Suffering through the realm of math")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```
the devil's in the details, they say

Tweet 5:
dare to enter the multiple plot matrix of doom, AKA "subplotting your way into oblivion"
```python
fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2)
axs[0, 0].plot(x, y)
axs[0, 1].plot(x, np.cos(x), 'r--')
axs[1, 0].bar(range(10), np.random.rand(10))
axs[1, 1].scatter(x, np.random.rand(100))
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
chaotic, frightening, useless...perfect

screw the ruler & protractor! we digital freaks now, hatching the ugliest pie chart in the world to remind ourselves of what we've become
```python
labels = ['Big Tech', 'My Wallet', 'Pleasures of the flesh']
sizes = [60, 20, 20]
colors = ['#ff9999', '#66b3ff', '#99ff99']
plt.pie(sizes, labels=labels, colors=colors, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=90)
plt.axis("equal")
plt.show()
```
may the gods forgive me

adventures in matplotlib, a window into the soul of darkness. but all good things must end, as this cruel thread comes to a close. never forget the atrocities we've committed here, and to cleanse our minds, we unbind the spirits
```python
plt.close('all')
```
peace out, sinners
