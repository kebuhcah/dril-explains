1/ alright asshoels, lets get one thing clear. Groot. the big skellington with bark. the wooden demon. no man, woman, or toilet can escape his twiggy grip. this is a thread Explaining "Groot" in Thorough Fashion. #GrootTalk

2/ the source of Groot's Power? It's fuckin trees. shit so obvious it makes my 300 IQ brain bleed. he goes from Small Plant Boy to Humongous Wood Creature faster than you can say "i'm sorry, i didnt see your lawnmower"

3/ What makes Groot different from your average tree? well first off, he can talk. sort of. second, he apparently can move, fight, and dance. a terrifying yet arousing combination of organic, raw nature and sheer goddamn attitude

4/ But does Groot feel pain? The most chiseled minds of my brain fortress have determined: Yes. Groot takes hits like a champ, but make no mistake–the tree feels PAIN. why else would he defend himself by throwin spikes at chucklefucks who dare cross his garden?

5/ And do not forget Groot's most iconic phrase: “I am Groot.” a statement so simple yet so powerful, it can leave one to ponder the sheer magnitude of its meaning. the answer lies within each of us, or perhaps none at all. truly the pinnacle of poetic nuance

6/ But Groot is not just a one-man (tree) show. Oh no. Groot belongs to the Guardians of the Galaxy: a misfit family of raccoons, aliens, and bat shit multi-being organisms who thrive on their collective chaos. At the heart of it all, Groot, the constant

7/ when the chips are down and the universe is in crisis, you can count on one thing: Groot will rise, tall & imposing, one million roots stretchin like an Arby's curly fry, crushing villains with the ferocity of a thousand burning nurseries

8/ Many have tried to bottle his energy - to cut Groot down and convert him into toothpicks or a charming picnic table. But Groot’s essence cannot be contained. He IS nature, and nature cannot be thwarted by the petty whims of mankind

9/ So as we bask in the glory of Groot, let us remember humilities place in the cosmos. From the tiniest of saplings to the grandest of oaks—power and resilience transcend enormity. Embrace the profound wisdom of Groot and let it seep into our veins

12/ end of thread. ive clearly established the rightful place of Groot in the halls of Universal Lore. any further attempts to define Groot is an assault on the fragile alliance between wood and man. I hope this knowledge serves one well. #GrootTalk
