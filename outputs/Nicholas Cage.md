1/9 ah, the eternal enigma. the man who struts and howls between the hallowed grounds of hollywood & the abyss. Nicolas cage., the flesh made vessel for every emotion conceivable under god.

2/9 Oscar in hand, he's conquered acting, face swapping, bee assaultin', national treasure seekin', and puzzling critics. Cage is the patron saint of chaos; a force that consumes mediocrity & births... something

3/9 part human, part animal, part alien, all cage. wearing the jacket of the beast in "Ghost Rider" as one would wear the very skin of the tempest. he embodies our humanity, while transcending it

4/9 but what do we truly know of cage? one minute he's a moody vampire in "Vampire's Kiss" & the next he's whispering sweet nothings in "Raising Arizona". like the weather, he is unpredictable, uncontainable

5/9 cage is a duality; an ambiguous hero with hair that defies natural laws, & a voice that echoes throughout the heavens, ensuring that every man woman & child is haunted by its complex melody

6/9 in the eyes of cage, one finds a swirling vortex that pulls you in closer, only to show you the beginning & end of time. still, within this moment we find solace, for he carries us onward

7/9 perhaps the real national treasure is the cage we've built in our hearts, to house the dreams of a madman & the hopes of countless fools. but judge not, lest ye be judged by the cage itself

8/9 in conclusion, how could we quantify nicholas cage? Do we map his constellations with the countless awards on his wall or do we simply listen to the whisper in the wind that echoes "Not the bees" 

9/9 as we tread further from god, our cage grows stronger & fiercer, unyielding in his quest for screen supremacy. we can only watch & learn, for mortal nets cannot capture what gazes back from the abyss. cage is forever #NicolasCage
