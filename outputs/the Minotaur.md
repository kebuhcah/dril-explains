1/6 once again forced to remind my followers, the so called "Minotaur" is a mythological creature– Half Bull, Half Man, All pure uncut bullshit

2/6 Legend says King Minos prayed for a solid gold bull, but God forgot to turn on power save mode so it became half man half beast. Extraordinary Spectacle!!

3/6 while others are blabbering about "Mazes" & "Labyrinths" in reference to the Minotaur, most don't even know a damn thing about the difference. Labyrinths: one way, Mazes: atleast 69 ways

4/6 Minotaur's diet: "virgin sacrifices" - not the sexual element I'm worried about but that the people have willingly accepted human sacrifices as a fad back in those days. Ancient YOLO

5/6 Daedalus, Labyrinth designer extraordinaire, also a well known prankster; crafted the world's first air accident when Icarus fell from the sky during a 5-star trip. (laughs in Ancient Greek)

6/6 the Minotaur— a reminder that even in the days of myths, the people craved spectacle, heroics & absolute nonsense. unlike now where we are blessed with an internet full of grounded unassailable TRUth
