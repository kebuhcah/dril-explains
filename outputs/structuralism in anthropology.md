1/7 Just found out about this thing called "Structuralism" in Anthropology. Apparently, it's not a DIY home repair guide for houses with weak foundations, but a whole ass way of decipher0ing cultures. My mind is a blown rotisserie.

2/7 New plan: Stop turning my brain into a cosmic soup of knowledge. Gotta break down these cultural sign systems like they're *checks notes* binary oppositions on a crime caper. Who knew "opposites attract" was all about language in motion?

3/7 Just found out these smarties like Levi-Strauss (not the jean people) analyze different societies as a "tense" game of Simon Says, where everyone nods and winces. Why? Not to catch villains, but to solve the ultimate puzzle: How #Aesthetic is this culture?

4/7 Ok, so the main goal here is to create a centralized computer that simulates every culture's brain waves to unlock the ultimate Truth. Alright, that's not entirely true, but they do wanna discover patterns, baby! Patterns that make the world go round like a vortex of Funk!

5/7 So I hear you ask: What's the point of all this? Well, it helps us create a neat little instruction manual for the maintenance of each culture's unbreakable spirit, like a god damn spiritual toolkit from Home Depot.

6/7 And here's the kicker: They say it's gonna make us throw up our outdated ideas like a freshly-purchased eBook from a vending machine. Are they trying to create Super-Humans? Possibly! But one thing's for sure, we're all just metaphors in this never-ending game called life.

7/7 In conclusion, Anthropology's got kinkier than ever, and we're gonna need to catch this wild cultural ride. So buckle up my friends because structuralism just blasted me into a new realm of understanding society! Signing off as Anthropo-@dril, the sagacious observer.
