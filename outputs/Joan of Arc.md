1/ Ah, yes, the fabled Joan of Arc, defender of Gods and scourge of the english; she who was both saint and madwoman, a slippery pole on which the internet opinions dance in tweet-form

2/ Friend : Joan of Arc - a simple teenage peasant girl with a penchant for visions, rode through hellfire and damnation to slap englishmen's asses for God. The textbook definition of "getting owned"

3/ To understand Joan, you have to first become lik Joan. Face paint and armor must not only protect your flesh, but also embolden the spirit within. Accompanied always by my sword Eustace, and my trusty steed "Bezerko" 

4/ And what was Joan's reward for her dedication to her voices from above? Being burned at the stake like one of guy Fawkes terrible effigies Which could have easily been avoided if she had replied to my letters, inundated with tactical advice 

5/ To summarize, Joan's meteoric rise, and subsequent demise, served as a lesson for us all: never trust the english, cower to the voices in your head, and when crusading for righteousness, always have a trusty sword,Eustace, by your side
