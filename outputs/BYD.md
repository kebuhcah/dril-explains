1/7 Just discovred "BYD" (Build Your Dreams) - is this a spiritual awakening or a global-industrial dream factory with the power to manifest vehicles like the sick wizard of the highway? #ConspiracyUnfolded

2/7 Folks, these cars are ELECTRIC! I'm tired of my gasoline addiction being the muse for the warlords of OPEC. BYD is the renaissance, the revolution, the fuel-efficient light in the darkness of our crumbling earth.

3/7 BYD doesn't just manifest automobiles, but BATTERIES too. The future isn't just cyberpunk and hat-wearing androids, it's people strapping batteries to their waist like a tactical, holographic fanny pack full of pure energy.

4/7 He who holds BYD holds UNLIMITED POWER or just enough power to run electric buses and forklifts? Time will tell, and I hear @elonmusk whispering secrets in the wind... the rivalry begins.

5/7 Pull up to the electric drive-thru ordering big BYD burger with a side of fries & a Volt-kale shake. I DEMAND this sustenance. If BYD can't provide, I will continue devouring the life force of big McDonald's clown.

6/7 Are we approaching an era where a man can charge his car, love, and own essence at home? This intersection of technology and lifestyle will happen whether we bend the knee to BYD or pray at the altar of the Pixel-bellied techno gods.

7/7 In summary, BYD may be the salvation or the doom, and I pledge fealty to the smooth highways and electrified cityscapes that it may bring. Will continue to invest in cryptosilk and micro-bots, but for now... see me glaze around town in my sweet, sweet BYD-ride. #ElectricEmpire
