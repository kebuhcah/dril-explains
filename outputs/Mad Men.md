1/ i cant begin to unpeel the onion layers of "Mad men". The art, the mystery, The Drinkers—each piece adds to the vast puzzle of tv show excellence. a sublime humanity it is.

2/ emboding the true talent, the chief Mad Man is the dude with the sexiest looks, and a mind that weaves webs of beauty like a denim spider - Donathan Draper. inventor of the Smug face. 

3/ the ad boys of the 1960s, suckin down cigs, signin contracts, and shitting out the taglines that shaped america's destiny. inescapably seductive. they are that which we yearn.

4/ subtlety is their game - a cruel ballet of manipulation as they descend into the decadent cauldron of venal sins. selling us cigarettes n dreams, and we salivate at their mercy. 

5/ love, lust & betrayal—shaken, not stirred. shall i compare thee to a summer's old fashioned? each episode dripping with the rancid juice of profundity by virtue of the Human Condition.

6/ beneath the glistening hairdos, dapper suits, and high ball glasses lies a tangle of red strings - charting the flaws and complexities of those who master the craft of Consumerism.

7/ their stories embroidered on the canvas of the American Dream, these ad men may be mad, but they are infinitely true to a bygone era. im honestly more of a sWireless Nerd type guy
