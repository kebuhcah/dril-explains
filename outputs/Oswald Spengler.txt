1/ just found out about this sick ass guy "Oswald Spengler" . love to see a dude predict the Destruction of our Civilization 100 years ago and still no one listens, incredible

2/ they call old Spengler's world view "pessimistic" because he thinks our culture's doomed like Rome. well guess what? I, dril, too jam a Big Mac into my mouth and drive my SUV into the ocean, simply embracing our degenerate fate

3/ thinkin bout how Spengler broke history down into "High Cultures" which each have their own lifespan & patterns. even made the shocking claim that pretty much every civilization before and after ours, was in fact, totally Fucked

4/ some people: (( sweating )) "ohh oswald spengler is a man of dark thoughts and gloomy pessimism, don't read him" .... me: ((smirking )) "too late, bitch"

5/ apparently Spengler hated both democracy & socialism, loved saying "Eternal Winter". which is the best combo for creating confused followers who aren't savvy about his theories; but damn, they know he was extremely cool and metal

6/ know what's funny? the fact that most scholars completely rejected spenglers wet+ wild theories of history,  which means the world got at least 50% less awesome. those Academics... can't trust their verdict on any Mind Blowers

7/ everytime a redditor argues with me i feel one step closer. one step closer to the downward spiral of societal collapse which Spengler himself foresaw like an absolute mfing madman 

8/ Oswald Spengler has the ultimate power move: bein dead for almost 100 years but still making people say "oh shit, he might be right" while they stare out the window and reminisce about their dying culture

9/ if spenglers model is true and we're all circling the drain of history, this means that I, dril, am strategically positioned with my finger hovering above the plunger, teetering between triumph and redemption

10/ in conclusion, Oswald Spengler was simultaneously the Original Pessimist King and Exceptional Thunderer of Predictions regarding civilization collapse. the man, the myth... my new best Ghost Friend. thank you
