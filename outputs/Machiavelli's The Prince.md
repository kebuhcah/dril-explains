1/ Just cracked open a tome of pure uncut wisdom, The damn Prince by Machiavelli. Get ready to join me on a mind-warping journey as I bestow Truth upon your pitiful timelines. Buckle up, cowards. #Machiavelli #ThePrince

2/ First things first: Machiavelli says rulers should be like lions AND foxes. Be hard & scare away wolves, but also be crafty & smug. If you we're a true ruler, you get it. I am an animal hybrid expert & fully endorse this message. #LionSmarts #FoxPower

3/ Listen up, peasants. Better to be FEARED than loved, but never hated. Machiavelli says keep your boot on their necks, just don't stomp too hard - or they'll hate your guts. Almost as if you've over-charged at your pawn shop. #FearMeButDontHateMe

4/ The Prince knows what's up. Rulers gotta be ready to get their hands dirty. Wring the neck of a goat, piss on a serf, eat a hot dog - no ketchup. Play dirty, be dirty, and they'll have no choice but to respect the grind. #MachiavelliStyle

5/ "History's greatest fool is the self-made ruler who hates riches." People love their cash, so keep the loot flowing - show small kindnesses like buying your serfs a Domino's pizza or sending a peasant two cents over Venmo. #MoneyPowerRespect

6/ Machiavelli? More like Hack-iavelli! Dude says being a good ruler means ignore the haters. Never let the malcontent rabble rousers bring you down. Hate stops a King's heart, but so does poison mailed by his enemies, so watch out. #ImprisonTheHaters

7/ In conclusion: The Prince - an instruction manual for ruling over craven fools. I give it 5 out of 5 pointing fingers. Thank u Machiavelli, for teaching us all how to exploit the weak, with style, grace, & a light fist. What a guy. #ThePrinceLyfe
