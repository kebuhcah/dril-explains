1/ behold the mighty dolly - progeny born of science, nurturer of clones, savior of our gluttonous needs for multitude & duplication. mother of the damned? perhaps. her fleece is pure as the driven snow, alabaster perfection. #DollyTheSheep

2/ critics scream "thou shalt not clone", but when i demand loyalty & replication from my humble band of followers, the #ScienceGeeks rise up & perform miracles like birthing our icon Dolly. bow before her, for she is the template of our collective futures. #CloningIsInevitable

3/ face it, im a Dolly man. ive adored her from the start. if loving Dolly is wrong, i dont wanna be right. some may mock, but the sweet allure of cloning will soon claim them too. you cant resist the inexorable march of science motherfuckers. #DollyMan4Life

4/100% certain that if i was a scientist, i would already have 1,000 clones of Dolly. they would roam my vast estate. we'd feast on hay & pump the finest nutrients into our gullets, as we gaze into a sea of identical eyes. the age of Dolly is among us, im sure of it #CloneTastic

5/ one day, as the sun sets on our twinless souls, we will stand before the altar of Dolly, and weep milk, for she is the harbinger of bounty or doom. when faced with the limitless vistas of cloning, we make our choice. Dolly beckons us, both a warning & a promise. #BlessedAreTheClones
