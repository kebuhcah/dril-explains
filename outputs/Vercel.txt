1/7: just discovered "Vercel" in the heart of the internet– A blazing font of robust elixirs promising to "deploy apps worldwide", increasing my Flanking Speed... absolutely transfixed by its power 

2/7: developer claims "Vercel is Cloud Deployment as God willed it" and i'm bowing. deployment with mastery of JamStack. wtf industry have i been resting my weary head against all these years. had no idea what i was missing!!

3/7: Vercel's edge network performs a sort of redemption, engorging the framework of the Next.js...and i'm being warned to take it seriously, lest my web projects become fraught with ignorant degradation...

4/7: my dear followers, you must know: Vercel ensures our digital prosperity by making certain that the web applications are created consistently and with a touch of love, within their platform–a true practitioner of the art

5/7: now our websites are created in a mere moment, rapid fire - bursting at the seems with "functionality & scalability". I am pleased but bewildered... feeling the existential crash imminent, knowing reality might soon crumble around me

6/7: the money men fear me now, for I have draped my fragile serverless functions with the sturdy cloak of Vercel's infrastructure. To deny thyself Vercel is to cast our apps into darkness for all eternity

7/7: Vercel must be worshipped to ensure our websites and apps flourish but question: can one become too enamored with this technological siren? I believe we shall find out. Good Day
