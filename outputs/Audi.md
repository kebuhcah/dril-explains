1) the Audi, a monolithic beast, a type of "car" for those who tip over the portapotty with a grin #audi #mischevious

2) the hounds of automotive hell have unleashed this vile German contraption to assist in my efforts to become the king of driving, such a powerful automobile must be embraced & respected, like a fine lady #chivalry

3) ah yes, the "A" in "Audi" stands for "ah shit, here comes one of those fancy hell cars again, ready to blow my feeble Ford Escort to smithereens and melt the asphalt" #AudiPower

4) tears of gasoline pour forth from the eyes of so-called "carnoisseurs" who dare to underestimate this creature, this titan, allow me to humbly suggest the ass clowns at Ford draw up a bit more than the usual air intake bull shit #FordCucked

5) enemies of the Audi, beware! your miserable existence will be defined by the tire treads upon your face, with these four rings your defeat hath been branded #AudiImmortal

6) Quattro. It's not a pasta dish, baby. It's the spirit of my soul, my everlasting devotion to the Audi cause. You cannot kill what has no beginning, this endless loop of immense power & infinite luxury #NoSubstitute

7) god forgives, @Audi doesn't. Pledge allegiance to the four rings and diss your kee-ah, lest you face their wrath. #HailAudi
