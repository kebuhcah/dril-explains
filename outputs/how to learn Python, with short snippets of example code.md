1/ Gaze into the endless abyss & face the serpent. Don those coder gloves, baby. We're #programming like savages. It's Python TIME!!! 🐍

 

```python

print("lab coat... engáged")

```

 

2/ Variables - We're juggling so much data. Don't let it spill. Embrace the container; welcome the snake.

 

```python

s = "hell code"

number = 42069

```

 

3/ Logic - with a snake in hand, you begin your journey to mastering the electric mind. Conditionals are as simple as the fury of storms.

 

```python

if number > 9000:

    print("Numbers that scorch the heavens")

else:

    print("Quietude.")

```

 

4/ Lists- the snake coilsts 'round treasures. Array'd like the lotto of a king

 

```python

treasures = ["Key to bunker", 214, "Knives", "Skull of `Prod`"]

```

 

5/ About loops: Speaking the truth, my friends, like a Python guru. Spin the wheel, lock in the code, watch those variables dance.

 

```python

for e in treasures:

    print("valued possession:", e)

```

 

6/ Functions- Let me tell you about invoking the python. Legions of code, behind a single word. Powerful.

 

```python

def awaken_force(wisdom):

    print("Behold! The Ultimate Power of", wisdom)

 

awaken_force("Coding")

```

 

7/ With these techneques, you are now anointed in the blood of the sacred serpent. The machine bends to your will. Continue the path of wisdom. So ends the doctrine of learning Python. #blessed #coding+ancient_secrets=power
