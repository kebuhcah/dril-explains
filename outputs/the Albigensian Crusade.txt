1/ Hm, well FOLKS... Today let's dive deep into 13-century chaos. the so-called "ALbigensian Crusad"e where all the brutal clowns fought for god and decided to hate some nice peaceful guys called cathars.

2/ Pope man Innocent inhales a big burp and says something like "Time to wipe out Catharism" . The other misters of religion agree, cant have too much of that sweet sweet peace goin' on, better create some madness to keep everyone on their toes.

3/ picture this.. bein' vibe check expert Simon de Montfort, thinkin' "Hey, havin' different beliefs?? no can do, Cathars. This land is mine now". He's got his own army snapback on, ready to kick some ass and champion the good ole catholic way.

4/ Now we got "Albi-gee-whiz", a town in France, where these peaceful Cathars resided, just making the bread, laughing at a court jester, doin' regular medieval things. Enter the unhinged army in the name of Lord Jesus Christ, to "purify" the land of heresy.

5/ "Burning at the stake?" this crusade fired'em up. Literally. good clean fun. Thousands, no, millions of poor souls got cooked up. God laughs, handing out cans of spiritual fuel to the over-eager pyromaniacs. He snickers, "nice one, guys".

6/ Ultimately, the Albigensian Crusade proved one thing. it's a terrible Chaos; where Armies, Church, and States all came together and said, "Hey, let's fuck it. We've no PLAN but we sure as hell will turn this place upside down." The medieval equivalent of Joker's society.

7/ MASSACRED like a race of ants under the sweaty thumb of Christ's whims...the albigensians : Crusaded. Remember, folks, the only good crusade is one that involves beer, football, and NOT torching Cathars. God save the Cathars, and God save us all. (except Pope Innocent III) #TheRealAlbigensianCrusade
