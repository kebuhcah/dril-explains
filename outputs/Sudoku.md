1/ ah yes, the ancient art of sedoku - an honorable practice loved by all.. cramming little numbers into box prisons till the gremlins in your head shut the hell up

2/ the rules of Sudooku: simple as your uncle's palm. force numbers 1 to 9, like unwilling pageant contestants, into rows and columns & boxes of 9. do i have to call numbers by their names? seems unnecessary..

3/ browsing the sudoku tutorial sections at my local book store like some sort of mathematic bloodhound.. drooling over the numbers.. all 9 of them..

4/ people don't realize the #power of sudoku.. it's like math, but stripped of its demonic algebra clothes. they call me the Sudoku King - a title i must at once reject on account of its insane implications

5/ the sudoku grid mocks me from behind its war paint of ink and slaughtered trees pulp.. i shall conquer you, 9x9 fiend, by assigning prisoners numbers into your jail

6/ some people say "do you spend your Saturdays doing Sudoku?" and i say "no you fool.." i call in sick on Mondays to do sudoku

7/ my Sudoku Mastery has earned me staggering amounts of power and prestige.. hell struggles to contain my dominion over numbers one to nine in a box

8/ sudoku is not just for dads, sad office workers & dog breeders anymore. it is for people who seek truth in this cruel world of disposable pen caps and worn out sandals

9/ and thus, my friends, the sacred code of Sud√∂ku hath been shared. let it be known that its mystical teachings shall spread like ink onto the porous fabric of this dying world
