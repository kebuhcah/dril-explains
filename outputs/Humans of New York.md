1/ No one cares about the so called "Humans of New York" ...posting pics of random men and women, wearing clothes and boasting about their bizarre lives. Sickening. #HONYlies 

2/ Imagine walking down new york street's , minding my own content, when some camera guy pops up asking for my "story". Im not giving away my secrets to big photography!

3/ To clarify, the phrase "Humans of New York" implies mere photographs can contain the raw power, the unfathomable depth, of an actual human. Unbelievable, folks.

4/ I propose, instead - the "People of New York" be put to work making better posts. Let us have people running rampant with pyramids and kegs, but keep their dirty litlte stories for God's ears only.

5/ The obsession with the people of this perverted city only grows - First it was hotdogs, then it was Broadway, now Humans of New York? Soon their pets will be in fashion. Mark my words.

6/ It's become clear: the only solution is to rise up, make our voices heard. Demanding an end to the horror of willingly exposing our lives to the lens of some rogue photography guy. #stopHONY

7/ In conclusion, if I finally muster up the courage to step foot in New York, I expect respect, no photos and only top quality posts to be made about my incredible presence. Thank you.
