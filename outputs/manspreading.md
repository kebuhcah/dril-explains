1/ just discovered the phenomenon they call "manspreading" - where men unleash their legs like a fucked up evil crane to conquer all Space. absolutely appauled

2/ i see a guy spread about 8 feet wide, one leg in next week, owning the bus so majestically . people worship him like some sort of sick god .

3/ guy next to me tests out the highest level of the manspread. his thigh rips thru the seat like a devastating freight train... I give gentle golf clap

4/ war general in my brain advises that if i do not "manspread", i will die with no heirs, shamed, and shit like a villain. it is now war within me.

5/ considering creating a "manspreading belt" to capitalize on this phenomenon. belt activates instant 180-degree leg split to protect your vital realm.

6/ asked gym instructor for a "manspreading work-out session". she called the cops. they arrived and we held court in the gym over my rights as a leg opener.

7/ "which has more power? my legs or my brain?" i ask myself as i attempt to manspread through these concepts in the crowded subway of human knowledge.

8/ the dawn of the final battle is now. the manspreaders vs the no-spreaders. only then shall true rulership be determined, and the path chosen.

9/ streets full of manspreaders, like a parade of mighty centaurs... in awe, i realize I cannot defeat this powerful foe, but I can join them.

10/ do not weep for the past. the age of the manspread is upon us. accept your fate and spread as wide as Poseidon himself or be crushed to dust.
