1/ ah, my friends, it is upon us. the dire "#KnockKnock Joke," a true travesty, a murky cauldron where logic goes to die. strap in as we explore the twisted depths of this humor nightmare

2/ step one; knock knock. two mock doors are created in this sad charade. a lonely plea for companionship or a threat of intrusion? your call. choose wisely, as the weight of the joke rests upon these trembling doors

3/ step two; delusions of grandeur. always some prick with a name that taints the air with piss; who's there? orange. ORANGE who? "orange you glad you summoned me from the joke hell?" no. i am not glad. Begone, "orange"

4/ the "victim" must thus expose themselves to the insidious punchline by asking with innocence: "who's there?" many fear to tread this path, knowing full well the mockery that awaits. the courage of the damned, they say

5/ for the comedy warlord, the prime moment has arrived; the punchline. a glorious wordplay that evokes annoyance and rage. no one is spared. men cry, women scream, but the joke has done its deed. the room is poisoned

6/ this mutual suffering is comedy indeed. and so, it ends as it began; knock knock. again, an unseen, unhinged door now slams shut â€” only to be reborn in the next #knockknock joke. thus continues the eternal loop of cruelty

7/ in conclusion, knock knock, who's there, perpetual torment. time for me to retire into the night and recover from this harrowing ordeal we've shared. remember, my friends: knock at your own risk. godspeed to us all #comedyhell
