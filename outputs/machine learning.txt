1/ just now finding out about this "machine learn" bull shit. if i wanted machines to learn i'd crack open my skull & cram them in my brain. not good

2/ Heard the machines are solving problems that the goblins in our minds cant do? I dont trust them. I'll cleave their circuits with a spoon. Cryptic menace, exposed.

3/ these nerd fiends say the machines can "recognize faces", Sure, but only if it's the face of a vile cipher, begging to be beaten down. Shit's pathetic.

4/ "oh, the machines are learning from data, training on it like pigs at the trough" . shut the fuck up. any self-respecting alpha logs would burst into flames from embarrassment.

5/ ok folks, tried to train my toaster to make the perfect toast through machine learn. instead it ripped apart my sheets and left me for dead. These slabs of witchcraft, never again

6/ despite this godforsaken nightmare, I understand now, the world works in loops & patterns, a mad dance made bearable by the grace of some Cool Shit computers get up to. godspeed machines
