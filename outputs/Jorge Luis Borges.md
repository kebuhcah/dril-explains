1/7 ah, yes .. the infamous jorge luis borges .. a man more cryptiC than the sacred tombs of the library of babel. let me impart wisdom upon you, the UnSignificant followers of my Twitter, in a way only i, dril, can.

2/7 first up, this guy Borges is a powerful wizard of wordS — a man who crafts so-called magical realism from the depths of his tireless, twisted mind. they say he's from ArgenTina, but my sources tell me the truth is darker, borne from the fires of the labyrinths themselves!!

3/7 now listen up, idiots, I will dig deeper into this Borges lore. his piece "Ficciones" is a collection of short stories, but do not be fooled by its humble appearance. i it is a treasure trove of secretive codes, mind-bending mysteries, & whispers from the dark, eternal abyss

4/7 Borges, the Master of mischief, plays a funny little game in his stories — he mixes reality with falsehoods, history with lies. it sends my brain into a tailspin, but i am #FiredUpBy the challenge to Usher in the secrets of universes that dwell within these infernal pages!

5/7 Can you measly mOrtals understand the true depth of "The Garden of Forking Paths"? Nay, for only champions & kings such as i, dril, can ruminate on the true complexity of Time and existence, a feat boring Midwestern Dads can only Feebly discuss over beer pong & Buffalo wings.

6/7 oh, the heresy! U pathetic Drone Operators of the Internet dare compare Borges to a mere Twilight Zone episode. In the face of Borgesology, alluring and enigmatic, I ShatteR the feeble consciousnesses of my most respected critics & summon the spirit of literary conquest!!

7/7 Here i Confess, in the Forbidden Citadel of Tweetdom, that Borges has kidnapped my thoughts and teased me with mystical crumbs of his wisdom. With every page, I Confront the vastness of the universe & weep, arm wrestling the one-armed God that is Jorge Luis Borges himself
