1/9 ah, the fabled New York Jets. a team of GridIron warriors who are like the regular boys in my hometown, except more absorbent, and extremely powerful. some may call them Gods. not me. still trying to understand the Jets "System" #FootballKnowledge

2/9 for context, imagine a crew of men who love to play a sport & get dirty. dirtstains all over their uniforms. they invited me to join them, but i will not accept as i refuse to play any games outdoors (allergies)

3/9 some claim these "Jets" have an aircraft of sorts, but round these parts we only acknowledge jets that exit my lawn mower. their power doesn't come from aviation, no, it comes from their hearts - the only true jet propulsion device there is. #RealJets

4/9 of course, the New York Jets have their fans. they call them "JetHeads". i see them flipping burgers and screaming with passion while their team is valiantly defeated. truly inspiring the masses to blend despair with loyalty.

5/9 let's address the quarterback, a man who tosses and grips the pigskin with his bare hands in ways i envy but cannot imitate. lord knows i've tried, but the spirits of the game require a lot more than tossing fruit at local businesses.

6/9 many speak of the 'coaching staff'. a cult of coaches that train these men to endure pain and mayhem. they create champions made of sweat, hard work and large billboards. wise men, but none of them have ever fought me in hand to hand combat, presumably due to fear.

7/9 sometimes - dark times - the Jets don't triumph. they walk off the field, heads hung low, as they count each blade of grass trampled beneath their feet. they think it's defeat. i see it as a testament to their refusal to fly, like birds who have forgotten their wings. #DefeatIsWin

8/9 everyone mocks the "New York Jets" because they play in New Jersey...but i know the truth. the ultimate goal is to merge both US states into a football empire called "New Jetsey" and rule the land...together. #ConspiracyFact

9/9 to understand the New York Jets is to understand "football" itself. with hearts of iron and helmets filled with intelligence, these men march onward conquering the field of dreams, tempting fate with every yard. may we all be blessed by their sacrifice. #FootballForever #JetsJetsJets
