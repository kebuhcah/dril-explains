1/ Get ready for the most epic rundown of the top Polish cinema masterpieces - the ones brave enough to stare directly into the soul of a nation and rip out its cosmic humor for all to behold. Strap in, you vipers. #PolishFilmBonanza

2/ Starting with the legendary 'Ida' (2013) - where a nun finds out she's the product of Nazi scum. A classic tale of impermanence, like me battling my landlord over my right to install a revolving door in my studio apartment. #ForTheLoveOfNuns

3/ Dive headfirst into 'The Hourglass Sanatorium' (1973): a fever dream of Time, as relentless as the onslaught of robocalls I get, day after day. This movie will make you question everything you understood about life, like why printer ink costs a fortune. #TimeIsAnIllusion

4/ Introducing 'Body/Cia≈Ço' (2015) - the mortuary's comedy. Only in Poland can you find humor in dead bodies and grief, like how I find laughter in the crushing weight of student loans. Embrace your inner vulture, you ghouls. #LettersFromTheCrypt

5/ 'Knife in the Water' (1962) - a tale of jealousy and sensuality on a yacht. Feel the taut tension and the sea breeze, like when I wear my mesh tank top to the grocery store and shoppers gawk in envy. #YachtLifeForNoLife

6/ Lastly, 'Dekalog' (1989) - Ten films for the Ten Commandments. This religious cheese-grater to the human spirit will rip out your soul and feed it to the pigeons, like finding out your neighbor used your Wi-Fi to download knock-off NFTs. #HolyOfHorrors

7/ So there you have it, these untamed demonic films will convert you and lodge themselves into your brain, like the ceaseless hum of my refrigerator tormenting me in my sleep. You've been warned & enlightened, now go watch these flicks at your own risk. #PolishFilmTakeover
