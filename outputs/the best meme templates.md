1/ Alright you dipshits, it's time for me to bless you all with my supreme meme wisdom. Let me guide you through the upper echelons of meme templates.

2/ First up, the "two buttons" meme. Torn between pizza and healthy salad? Slip your greasy fingers into the keyboard, and slap together a quick one. The struggle is REAL.

3/ Let us not forget my good friend Drake. The "Drake Hotline Bling" meme transcends generations. Whether you approve or disapprove, this template is a surefire way to get your point across with style and confusion.

4/ "Surprised Pikachu" - what even is that goddamn rat? Poke-freak or not, this meme template captures the sheer essence of realization in a way words simply cannot do justice. Fear not Pikachu, for you shall remain in our hearts forever.

5/ "Coffin Dance" - an instant classic. Don't be a grave-digger of joy, enjoy the absurd dance of life (and death) and mourn the passing of your dignity in the process.

6/ And now, the "Expanding Brain" meme. We've all reached those high IQ points in life, so why not share your brilliance? Cluster your huge brain cells to imagine scenarios to fit this masterpiece. 

7/ I've turned dials, but no other meme template has filled me with fury like the "Monkey Puppet". The side-eye of collective avoidance is branded back into my skull. Use this meme, and I'll know you're hiding something.

8/ Consider now the enigmatic "Distracted Boyfriend" - a modern romantic twist to your dilemmas, betrayals, and indecision. He shall symbolize our eternal hunt for the next pocket of serotonin.

9/ In conclusion, my blessed followers, I have gifted you the meme templates to rule the kingdom of the internet. Grieve not, for I am the gentle shepherd, guiding you through the green pastures of meme culture. In my wisdom, we shall reign supreme.

10/ Finally, should you bastards misuse these templates, know that I shall rise from the depths of pixel hell to remind you of your lowly positions. Just use these templates responsibly and, as always, keep your feet on the ground and your head in the memes. END THREAD
