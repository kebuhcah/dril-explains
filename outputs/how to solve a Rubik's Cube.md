1/ ah yes, the fabled "cube of colors" or as the experts call it, "rubik's fucker". many have tried and failed to harness its chaotic wisdom. it's time for the ultimate guide to mastering this cubic demon

2/ step one: gaze deep into the psychedelic abyss of the sticker hell. contemplate your own folly in attempting to tame this cubic bitch; that is the unwieldy enigma of the 80s. stare long enough and the colors will begin to mock you.

3/ step two: assert dominance. remind the cube who's boss by yelling at it until your vocal cords can bear no more. the cubes respect strength, and diplomacy is for PITIFUL SQUARES.

4/ step three: lubricate. some say cheating by using cube grease, wd-40, or the tears of those who have failed before is the cowards path. i say it's extreme gaming for masters with pristine brains.

5/ step four: employ the algorithmic arcanum passed down through generations. U R U' L' U R' U' L or so the prophecy states. but what do these cryptic letters mean? some things man was not meant to know...

6/ step five: sometimes in life, we must become one with the unbeatable foe. become the cube. feel the visceral torment of each impossibly aligned corner. experience the ecstasy of finally being solved after years of torment.

7/ if all else fails, tear the cube apart, and rebuild it in perfect harmony, for the victory of having outsmarted the Devil's colored toy will remain sweet, even if we ourselves have become the very pit of despair.

8/ end the journey by savoring the moment of solidarity with the cube, acknowledging the fallen who came before you. shatter it into pieces and scatter them upon the battleground of past failures, leaving it for future generations to ponder.

9/ in conclusion, those who dare to solve the Rubik's Cube must walk a path paved with torment, self-doubt, and anguish. however, emerging victorious will cement your status as a true master of the cubic arts, and grant you entrance into the hallowed halls of the Dril Elite. #winning
