1/7 ah, the 2010s... a decade filled to the brim with tales of terror and tastelessness. The masses may have chosen their champions, but its time for the forgotten terrors of this foul time to rise From their graves and gnaw upon the living.. again

2/7 first we unearth "berberian sound studio" (2012), a trip down the rabbit hole of auditory torture that warps the very essence of reality around you.. simply put.. the loud man wins.. as always

3/7 next up, "the blackcoat's daughter" (2015), a chilling reminder of the icy grip that's ready to snatch us all up the second we forget our coats & moms. young girls, satanic panic - this ones got it all... 

4/7 allow me to introduce "resolution" (2012), a cruel, unyielding defiler of all things you once thought sacred. Its meta approach to horror makes you question what you're even watching anymore.. are you the captive? or are you the hostage?

5/7 don't forget about the harrowing "the iranian vampire western"  which is actually 2014's "a girl walks home alone at night"â€¦ sorry i got the title wrong its not actually about a vampire western

6/7 no one quite speaks of 2010's "wake wood", merging ancient pagan rituals & true heartache in a tale that pulls no punches. resurrecting the dead has never been so insightful or wrenching.. much like ur tweets

7/7 the 2010's may have ended, but the rituals remain - digging up graves of forgotten horror films while i quench my undying thirst with monster energy. they stay in the shadows, lurking until the time is right to strike fear into your hearts once more. #UnderratedHorror
