1/ alright folks get ready for this one - i'm diving deep into the silky, abyssal world of Quenya. the forbidden language of elves, mastered only by hardcore linguists & guys who write elvish erotica. I'm about to become fluent in this sexy tongue

2/ first up - Quenya aint your grandma's gibberish. it's the ancient language created by papa tolkien himself for his leggy elves with slick hair. Elves in the Lord of the Rings casually drop sweet lines of Quenya to absolutely annihilate their foes' egos

3/ what's the deal with Quenya? Basically its a "Constructed Language", which means it has been scientifically engineered for MAXIMUM word mouth feel. They say if you can master this, its like shooting the alpha waves directly into your brain computer core

4/ got a long ass word? Doesn't matter in Quenya, baby. Elves love slapping syllables together like a mad scientist chucking together chemicals. Connect those roots, throw some suffixes on, and bam - You've got yourself a lethal mouth weapon to impress your friends at brunch

5/ if you want to enter the velvet world of Quenya, you better be prepared for some hardcore pronunciation action. It may look like alphabet soup, but it's the language responsible for turning on the moon, i think. One mispronounced phrase could unleash a cosmic disaster
