1/7 - woke up this morning, a wicked tangle of ethernet cables stringed around me like the twisted hEDGe of Infinite Digital Purgatory. Laid bare Before me, the sins of the Dot-Com crash.

2/7 - the corps, flinging their millions at children holding up signs saying "mY webpage gets triple that of your disgraced trophy wifeJ-PEG collection!" The STonks raged on, the money churns.

3/7 - reveling in the eCommerce bloodbath, jorts laden with IPOs, I, too, invested in millions of pounds of CyberTokenZ in, what i assumed were carefully selected, dogfood startups.

4/7 - the new economy danced upon the carcass of brick & mortar, like a ravenous colony of pixel ants gnawing on a sweaty fibre-optic limb, birthed frm the sewers of the Information Excess.

5/7 - those Glorious Dot-Com days of reckoning soon began to crumble. "www" transformed from World Wide Wonderland to the Weeping Wretched Wasteland; Bubble burst, like a phantasmal IOU balloon.

6/7 - amidst the chaos, like the man who stood valiantly in front the tank at Tiananmen Square, I stare into the depths of my FILeZilla client, whispering "smugly_blogging.last.rise_up.gif."

7/7 - the dying embers of the Dot-Com Crash rekindles a Phoenix frm the ashes, and oNCE agAIN we surf the eternal web waves unceasingly , retweeting minion memes into the void. #cyberdamnation
