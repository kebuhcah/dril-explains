just found out my computer has something called "defragmentation". sounds cool as hell. who knew the cyber wars would come to this

Tweet 2:
defragmentation is when the computer wizard puts all your files back in order. like a janitor , but for your hard drive. truly we are the masters of these powerful machines

Tweet 3:
apparently my computer is "fragged to shit", like a victim of some holy cyber battle, and needs immediate resuscitation. game over for now, i guess

Tweet 4:
some of you doubt the power of defragmentation in 2021, but i'll have you know it gave me the strength of a thousand bytes. two more of these and i'll be the world's top cyber athlete

Tweet 5:
every time I defrag, my computer whispers sweet nothings to me like it knows my true desires. pray for my soul as I ascend into digital heaven, for I may soon become one with the .jpeg files

Tweet 6:
enemies of my PC's health, begone! the defragmentation wizard currently banishes them to a realm beyond the magnetic stripes of oblivion. to hell with your fragmented hard drives

Tweet 7:
experts say defragmentation is now "largely irrelevant" due to SSD technology, but i refuse to give up my ancient rites of passage. we must preserve our cyber-heritage in these confusing times
