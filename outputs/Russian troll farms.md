1/12 dont even bother trying to decipher the mind of the "Russian troll farm" monsters. lock your account if you see a profile picture of a bear holding an AK-47 in a tracksuit. these fiends are unfathomable. 

2/12 absolutely no one, and i wont stress this enough, NO ONE can escape the wrath of the cyrillic menace. i've been "trolling" for 20 years and if i even skim a tweet that resembles their style i'll melt down like a man made of ants

3/12 we must establish a strong, powerful defense for the good lords of Twitter against the dreaded "troll farm" marauders. i am calling on all REAL americans to engage in patrol mode on this hellish website

4/12 the average russian troll is simultanously a genius and a buffoon. their tactics, calculated with the precision of elite machine; the motive, sheer chaos. Like a shark made of algorithms, yet somehow robotic in their idiocy

5/12 let us not be defeated by misfortune, allow our minds to become fertile like the unkempt lawns of our youth. we shall overcome and triumph, as i remember eliminating trolls from my forums by drowning them in jpeg artifacts

6/12 it is crucial to launch a massiveshadow crusade upon the russian troll leaders. i am proposing a new missle system that spreads content awareness in the face of this threat, and also shoots beans at high velocity to incapacitate them.

7/12 intellect vs cyber-thuggery; whos to say what morphs our world into a desolate hellscape where the russian troll and american citizen fight hand in keyboard. to borrow a quote from my own forum admin: "this will not stand."

8/12 Putin's haunted carnival of digital terror must be held accountable. dismantling the troll farms, which we know exist & are hiding in every shadow, like wind spiders. waiting to infest your mind with lies and fear

9/12 any dissenters will be financially and morally reprimanded by the fed agencies that keep my balls untouched. US enforces will drench the ru-net in virtual blood, as I, behind closed drapes, watch through the cyber-magnifying glass

10/12 i did the math today and found that the Russian Troll-to-American ratio is 1:1. which means, statistically, each of you probably have at least one Troll in your life. so think carefully, and maybe don't piss me off trying to find yours

11/12 Note to russian trolls: everyday, i hold the cursed blowtorch of truth, ready to scorch your insidious plots. our cause is righteous and our hearts full. consider yourself warn'd, nefarious creatures

12/12 the End is near for these cursed Troll farmers. they will meet their final reckoning with the swift hammer of the internet's unyielding justice. their cables shall burn, rendering them powerless, as our cyber-rapture commences. mark this warning #RIPTrollFarms
