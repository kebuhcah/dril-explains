1/7. waking up to the giant orb hanging in the sky like it owns the place,. the "Sun." scientists say its a molten star made of bullshit gas. i call it a big round asshole roasting my skin

2/7. "BUT DRIL", they tell me. "Without the Sun, there can be no Life". well my Friends.. i say try LIVING at night. theres no sun then is there? answer, No. we have defeated the Sun.
 
3/7. “The Sun Helps! Harvest”, Nutrition-Boys cry inside their cowardly Vegetable Forts. I Spit on the Sun, invoking its Wrath. Thirsty for Conflict, it favors the Tires of my 2006 Nissan Rogue

4/7. where was the Sun when i, King of Smart Guys, accidentally stayed up for 72 hours? it happened twice NO Help came forth. MR. SUN I Fear not your Eternal Gaze, nor your Sickly Rays

5/7. solar panels are The Battle Master minds play to exploit the sun for ill. we harness its painful energy to cause it distress, stuck to a roof to teach the sun "dont even begin 2 fuck with guys like me"

6/7. helios, apollo, ra. these are the names of sun gods whom we appeased before we flipped the script and made god HATE the sun. now only he holds power to go full pelt on sun if required

7/7. the sun: necessary evil? sources say yes. will it finish us off? believe it friend. someday it will gulp up the planet earth in one gulp as if doing shots at the bar. we will be like, "you won"
