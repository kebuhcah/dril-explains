1/ ah,. the ancient texts whispered it in my ear, "ugaritic", a language so old it dont even fuckin know what a computer is . prepare youre self for knowldge, shit heads . 

2/ ugaritic.. the forgotten tongue of some dead assholes. they scrawled their shit all on clay tablets, makin it hard as hell to google. a tragedy of culture, wiped out by innovatons like "paper". RIP. 

3/ ugaritic wasn't all worthless though. shoutout to 30 goddamn consonants and no vowels, like trying to do a crossword puzzle while chokin on alphabet soup. still better than trying to decipher emoji's. 

4/ you know what saved ugly-ass ugaritic language from complete obscurity? damn straight -- myths and legends !!. fun times watching gods & losers fumbling on their misadventures. way before netflix took all credit.

5/ yeah, they had an epic called "Ba'al Cycle" and no, its not about marauding through the town on a tacky bicycle, you imbeciles! its about gods controllng the weather, like some ancient bullshit weather app.

6/ i went back in time to study Ugaritic, and the grammar police just gave me a ticket for butchering a dead language. how dare me, disgracin ancient dialects, while engageing in epic twitter combat.

7/ in conclusion, ugaritic is a dead as fuck language that absolutely rules the "ancient text" category. i will continue to channel their chaotic spirits in every incoherent tweet i fire off. ugaritic, welcome to "дрil"-verse.
