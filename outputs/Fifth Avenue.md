1/4 ah,, yes. the illustirious 5th avenue... home of the rich, the glamours, and the freaks in big, man-sized suits. a haven for the divine elites, should i say? or should i not speak of these secrets....

2/4 Traversing this bejeweled strEet, one may find treasures, stores selling tiny expensive rocks, designated to be attached to our stinken bodies, in a prove of worth. Displaying our wealth of trash bags full of green paper disks.

3/4 fellow pedestrians perhaps discussing the next niftiest ponzi scheme, or maybe just yelling about how good their pesto sandwich was, its beautiful mayhem. and deep within this chaos... a concrete jungle heart beats.

4/4 as for me, basking in the polluted glow of luminous billboards, one thing becomes bracingly clear: i do not belong here; for i have zero dollars and negative 45 pairs of Pants. god bless you fith avenue. I am become a Phantom at your table.
