1/ im told theres a television show where people sing gargabe loudly into camera lenses for the right to become a Famous Singer. It's called "the Aristocrats" or some shit. Am i correct.

2/ ah fuck. I've been informed it's actually called "American Idol", and is entering its 553rd season. I apologize for my mistake. I will now go feral and feast upon my own foot.

3/ unbelievably, each week, millions of households gather around their big glossy TVs to witness voice battles, a shouting contest of strangers screaming for survival. we decide their fates with phones, like horny roman emperors.

4/ "American Idol" is built on four pillars: a tall british gremlin, a human plastic surgery experiment, an indomitable singing titan, and a lady with the eternal soul of 50000 randy dolphins. they gather to pass judgement & consume souls

5/ Sometimes guest singers enter the fray, their aging careers gasping for breath amidst these fresh meat contestants. There is only one option - to absorb the youth energy in a ritual called "Performance Night"

6/ The top prize is a record deal that grants you legal permission to churn out mediocre songs for commercial breaks and also force the producer to buy you one (1) car of your choice

7/ speaking of cars, i've just found out that a Subaru dealership near my residence is holding auditions for the next season of this Devil's Play. If you see a man in a cape and cowboy hat, say hi & maybe get ready for a spiritual awakening.

8/ People have tried to warn me against participating in this song circus of doom. To them i declare: "There is one truth. That is, i have a golden voice & it's time to unleash it upon the world. Prepare for Harmony Hell, fuckers"

9/ in conclusion, "American Idol" is a television program where America watches potential idols duke it out with high notes and acrobatics. A feeding ground for fame and despair, all tied together with the magical gift of song
