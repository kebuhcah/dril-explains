1/ "Late Anquity"?? more like "Late 2 the party"- after dropping my phone in a barfight about seasonal detergents. anyway heres the deal jack, back when my Roman boys were losing steam and boundaries were blurrier than my texts after 7 beers

2/ So...romans got sick of buying ghost town gift shops hoping to find the glory days in the bargain bin. started twising their pant a bit into jumuPHPphhA or what ever bullshit language we dont use, and saying "uhhh christianity is like soooo hot right now"

3/ Didnt i tell you? Costantine or however the fuck you spell it, gets an idea in his littlel snake brain head too "legalize" Christians. what a fuckin flip wop! now they're ALL worshipin Christ as if he was some sort of jack pot lottery winner. who's even pilate anymore?

4/ That's not all though, folks. Late antinque city? more like antique yard sale. barbarian dudes bustin inside with their stanky feet and messin around. roman empire's a frog in a blender- trying to put the pieces together before they get pureed. Goodluck lol

5/ Just when u thought it couldnt get worse, my boy Attila enters the chat. honk honk, its party time bitches. You want to hear about Goths? Hell, I was a Goth in high school. These Eastern Goths were just kinda sleepy, and not just from wearing too much eyeliner.

6/ Its like witnessing a train wreck while eating popcorn- all the while wishing u saved the receipt for ur roman bathhouse membership. "late anquity"? more like "late to notice ur empires folding in on itself like a cheap yard sale tent"

7/ Might be the end of the thread but it sure ain't the end of late anquity. more of this headache 2 come if i can find someone to shovel me into the furnace of knowledge. stay tuned folks...  #LateAnquity #RomanEmpire #MakeRomeGreatAgain
