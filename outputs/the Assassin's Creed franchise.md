1/ ah.. the "Assasin's Creed.." the fabled Video Gam√© were you conquer the world one parkour jump & hidden blade thrust at a time. but who are these assassins ? who are we Creed-ing for, actually?

2/ wearing hoods so sharp they ought to be a weapon.. these "Ass-Ass-in's" got the drip to end all drips. cannot walk past one of these fine gentlemen without gawking at their impeccable wardrobe. all in the name of blending in

3/ The Templars.. The venomous snakes of History! face them, the fool's paradox: the more you stab them, the more their bloodthirsty organization thrives. You grab one, and twelve secret ones grow in their place like a horrible conspiracy hydra.

4/ imagine spending centuries training in secret for the ultimate blade battle with your nemesis only to become a damned fisherman in the later game installments. Ubisoft's cruel joke on us all

5/ jumping into haystacks all day and seeing the gods itself in code. deciphering the true essence of reality from a floppy disk in a basement. Is it "The Animus," or my home office?

6/ "Ezio Auditore da Firenze," "Altair." "Edward Kenway." just reading these powerful ass-ass-in names makes me levitate 3 feet off the ground, and whispers the secret truth of time travel into my mind

7/ do not even get me started on ABstergo industries.. its like they took every concievable evil and packed it into an office building. just thinking about it makes me want to crush a renaissance urn of vital lore with my raw hands

8/ in conclusion, the Assassin's Creed franchise is the ultimate roller coaster through history, murder, and simulation theory. A wild ride that makes me decide whether to throw my computer off a tall building or purchase a hood and gauntlet set. essential gaming for Dril.
