1/18 Ah yes, the webs unspoken desire. The sultry substance that powers strange men's biceps & torques their mental chariots - "Reddit Karma"

2/18 Imagine, if you will, the power to harness the depths of both public esteem and ignominy, a currency that fuels a thousand posts. the shit that keeps nerds up at night, vibrating in filthy beds with the fire of validation... a "coin" with "value"? fuck that. Karma

3/18 This cryptic point system known only to an elite coven of laptop alchemists & desk hunchers, is Reddit Karma. It exists Yet they deny it. I wage a terrible struggle against it in the subreddits, jacking off to the rhythm of new karma ass-loaders

4/18 Each submission & comment judged, by a panel of esteemed ghouls, selecting the thrall of accepted content. up vote, down vote, left vote, transvote - each collapse into dizzying spirals until Reddit Karma is gifted or stripped away, like so many online pelts

5/18 Behold, the Necromancer's creed: hoard, cherish, wield the elusive Reddit Karma, breathe deeply of its intoxicating essence. but is this a life we can live? no, some may say, nay even i. tis a path i chose not to forge, lest i defile the sacred bonds of the net

6/18 Instead, I, the ambassador of twisted thought, must continue to cast forth masterful content into the depths of Twitter, a sea of text that knows no silly numbers. No karma to weigh me down, no chains to bind my penchant for the perverse

7/18 Remember this: as much as Reddit Karma fuels the nuclear reactors of posters' hearts, to seek it is to cross the perilous bridge to oblivion..dine with the DarkLords of the cursed realm, even in triumph, you may find a treacherous foe, yourself

8/18 When all is said and done, the eternal battle between pleasure and indispensability is waged, and Reddit Karma stands as the arbiter of our souls. I laugh, cry, shit and piss in its presence, ever aware of its dark majesty
