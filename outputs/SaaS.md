1/ alright folks buckle up and prepare for the relentless inescapable force that is "SaaS" -- Software as a Actual Service, for those who can't just buy the shit and rub it on their faces.

2/ imagine if you will, a world so dark, so depraved, that you can no longer simply purchase a cursed software and be done with it. instead you subscribe to that hell like it's some unholy magazine of eternal updates and problems.

3/ "SaaS" is for the Chads of the software world, who believe that owning a disc isn't strong enough - they must establish a parasitic relationship with the software like a demon host, syphoning money from your wallet for the privilege.

4/ I hear you loud and clear: "why the fuck would i want to be ensnared in some demented lease with my precious programs?" well my dear morons, SaaS promises to be a merry-go-round of support and updates that makes you feel like the King receiving treatment in HELL.

5/ what's the big deal, you ask? it's just like Netflix, but for code gremlins in your computer, stealing your snacks every time you want to use Microsoft paint, still can't draw for shit, but you pay for it like some proud tick on the ass of technology.

6/ SaaS is the future they say, as we're all destined to be slaves to our software overlords, paying them tribute on a monthly basis so they'll be kind enough to let us type our genius thoughts in Google Docs & print "Saturdays Are For The Boys" in spreadsheets.

7/ in conclusion, if "rigid" "products" that are finished & static won't do it for you, if you seek to be taken to the depths of software hell every time you click, then congratulations, for "SaaS" is here to lead you unto damnation with its ambiguous charm.

8/8 so, strap in and say goodbye to the comfort of boxed software and hello to a lifetime subscription to suffering, you shit pigs. may the SaaS gods have mercy on your cloud-based souls. #SaaS #TheFutureIsBleak #GodSpeed
