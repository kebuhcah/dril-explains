1/ ah, the chaos enfolds as i witness the majestic beast that is "Blue Ruin," a 2013 delicacy of film craft. the title, a pungent assault on my taste buds, savoring it as i sip my morning brew - Brugal rum spiked with murky blue Gatorade #CinephileRuins

2/ "Blue Ruin" is a tale of revenge dipped in thick grime, the very essence of sweet sweet justice mangled in life's grubby embrace. revenge, a dish best served lukewarm upon a styrofoam platter (and perhaps on a diner seat alongside a heaping plate of scabby hash browns) #Honor

3/ Our protagonist - Beard, Hair, Tattered Clothing... the quintessential American vagabond seen in all my broken dreams, clawing his way towards his primal goal with a dogged ferocity that would make an eagle weep a single tear - or drop a lug nut from 38,000 feet #Reboot

4/ A gun lies heavily in his palm, a lead-weighted extension of pure retribution. His third arm, a truly phallic testament to humanity's endless quest for power and survival on this metallic hellscape we call Earth. #ProjectileBrotherhood

5/ The film's visceral hues rotate around a primary color palette: Blue, the calming interplay of blood and bleach on an ill-fated afternoon; Red, so vibrant as it sprays across the dimly lit walls, a Jackson Pollock dance celebrating vengeance's eternal symphony #RuinRhapsody

6/ Blue Ruin, a symphony of ass-kicking and redemption; a high-octane cinematic blast off that drifts in and out of human morals more seamlessly than my attempts to pay off debt collectors #ICantPayYouWithRetweetsGuy

7/ So let the curtain fall on this captivating tale, as we bid adieu to the theatrical arena and re-enter the real world - perhaps less prepared to deal with life's brutal injustices, but firmly rooted in the knowledge that some mistakes were just, absolutely, made #FinBlueRuin
