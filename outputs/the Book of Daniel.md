1/ Ah yes, the tale of a strong BOY named daniel who fought against the Food bastards in mysterious BABylon â€“ strap in for this bone crunching TIme saga, as i spit the truth Yet Again & expose the roaring secrets of whats-In-the-Bible #BookOfDaniel

2/ Enter "King Nebuchadnezzar" - some sort of huge metal head who forces all the kingdom to watch him eat garbage food. but danIEL remains untainted by this evil cuisine, and develops buff powers, transforming himself into a Radiant beast. #DamnDaniel

3/ This pisses the king off real good, so he locks daniel and his 3 best bros in a burning hot burn-atorium. BUT GUESS WHAT - they survive, cause God loves those who stay true to their Meals! absolute #Badasses never compromise & emerge Untouched

4/ Meanwhile, the king is haunted by visions, like when I slam a gallon of mountain Dew and lay down, my brain goes into overdrive, forcing itself into prime-problem-solving mode. Daniel deciphers the visions of the king and God tips his top-hat to him and promotes him. #KingStuff

5/ Eventually this King starts kicking up cosmic dust & gets turned into an Ass for 7 psychotic years, Learning his lesson. When he comes back, he's so revved up about being God's golden boy that he practically kisses the Floor. #CrawlingBackToGlory

6/ Fast forward and we get some guys who trick a new king into tossing Daniel into a lion's den. They say this is more like it. But the Lord is watching, and he jams a divine Cork into each lion's face, deafening the roaring carnivores. #NotTodaySatan

7/ Daniel busts out of the den, now promoted to chief President of the Lions, and those who doubted him are shredded up in there instead. This is a lesson for all yous: Never mess with a man who knows his bible and has the strength of a godly #BuffAngel!

8/ So there u have it folks - Follow your heart, eat your vitamins, and dont let anyone force u to eat garbage or backstab u in a cosmic tale of justice. God loves his warrior boys, and the Book Of Daniel proves this every single Day. #TheEnd
