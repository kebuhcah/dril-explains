1/ ah, march 2020. the month where the world went from "ehh" to "oh fuck". hope everyones prepared to enter the wretched, sickly miasma that is "quarantine hell zone". #March2020

2/ i remember turning the calendar to march 2020 and seeing it switch to "CORONAVIRUS MODE". even my damned calendar is terrified of the relentless disease-carnival. what gives.

3/ suddenly everyone's a goddamn pro at washing their hands. like that shits a new fad. as for me? I've been washing these bad boys since before it was cool. im a hand sanitizing hipster bitch.

4/ with toilet paper running scarce these days, let us all bow down to the new elite class– the precious owners of Soft, Bountiful Wiping Materials. The TP barons will rule the future dystopia. mark these words.

5/ everyones stuck at home losing their god damn minds while i simply refuse to obey the laws of nature, running around without mask and screaming "im superhuman" to prove im superior. cowardly germs never get me

6/ march madness cancelled?? what the fuck am i supposed to do now with my basketball fanatic disorder. ive got dribbling disease & all my neighbors now hate me, thanks to #March2020

7/ they say the virus thrives in enclosed spaces. im crunching the numbers & I realize— the absolute best way to crush this covid19 pussy is to bombard the earth with massive fans. cant survive if the air keeps blastin.

8/ I dont give a shit who starts hoarding designer masks or artisanal hand sanitizer. ya'll still weaklings. I will remain the unbreakable, unmoving and iconic "quarantine shitpost king". long live march 2020.
