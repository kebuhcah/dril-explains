1/ Ah, yes, my wise and erudite followers, the time has come to gather huddled masses, gaping in awe at the revelation of the mighty Gershom Scholem, mystic man of the ages, illuminator of Kabbalah's shadowy realms. Brace for Impact

2/ Scholem, or "Ger-sh-man"as his closest, greasiest associates called him, was the ultimate dabbler in the forbidden fruits of Jewish mysticism, prying open the crusty tomes of Kabbalah with his bare hands and sweaty brows.

3/ Our boy Gersh took a deep-dive into the abyss of Kabbalistic strands, untangling the twisted cords of creation, and lo! He discovered the dank memes dispersed by God Himself in the form of "sefirot" and "ein-sof" - absolute game changer fellas.

4/ With the brazen wings of a thousand angels, Gersh soared through the vast panorama of Jewish intellectual history, crouching atop the hulking giants of the past in order to dunk all academia into the abyss - like a true visionary.

5/ One can only imagine Gersh, hunched under the flickering candlelight, his fingers dancing into the intricate secrets of the mystical texts, scrawling furious notes as if possessed by the very spirit of the Kabbalah itself - an intoxicating vision for us all.

6/ And yet, despite his electrifying pursuits and piercing insights into the esoteric secrets, Gersh remains a humble servant in Twitter's court, willing his wisdom into 280-character morsels for the unwashed masses - a true king among men.

7/ In conclusion, let not our quest for flaming memes and sick burns eclipse the Herculean labors of the venerable Gershom Scholem, scholar of scholars, detector of divine whispers, and unmasker of the Kabbalistic codes - may we all etch his essence into our greasy hearts. End
