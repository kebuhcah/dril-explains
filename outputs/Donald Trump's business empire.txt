1/ ah, yes. the mighty trump biz empire. a powerful tower of economics, built on a mountain of big brain deals - and im no t"ax man"

2/ they say trump ate raw deals for breakfast. just chomped down on good ventures like a great white shark. those towers didnt build themselves

3/ enter the "Apprentice". they climbed the tower like puny ghouls, begging for trump wisdom. most vanished. some got "fired". power moves only.

4/ remember the "university"? some called it a scam. i call it trump academy of power excellence. never went, but i learned much. got the degree on eBay

5/ ive seen these Casinos , folKs. big, bright, and shiny - just like america's heart. coin slots & smokes. a sanctuary of fortune, where i squander it all.

6/ let us not forget... the art of the Deal. the sacred text. every true patriot has one. some say it wrote itself. others claim trump penned it on the back of a napkin.

7/ a legacy now in the hands of "trump steer". edible statues built in His likeness, to feed the hungry masses. we can all eat like kings, if we so choose.

8/ final thought - if i had billions, you bet your ass my towers would stretch to the heavens as well. and Id evict the biggest cloud.

9/ in conclusion, the trump biz empire - a monument of the human spirit. every tower, a new chapter. every deal, a testament. may we all strive to build our own tower of deals. Amen.
