1/ "ah Yes-- the beautiful "guantanamo Bay".. resort of the damned, where one can enjoy a complimentary cocktail of Uncertainty, and the tender caress of Deprivation. #ParadiseLost"

2/ "the epic weepers moaning 'is what goes on in guantanamo bay perhaps a touch cruel?' its a bay of tears for god's sake. people are oblivious to poetry these days. #BayOfSobs"

3/ "scream at the government to tell us the truth about Gitmo, and all we hear is radio silence, and the barely audible whisper of war crimes?? Speak up!! #PhoneIsRingingForJustice"

4/ "those who say 'shut gitmo down' are the same fools who would kick a bee hive to end The Pain. ignorance is a flaming sword that scorches the earth of sense. #WeAreAllHiveless"

5/ "in this twisted age of "human rights", we must not forget that Guantanamo Bay is merely a mirror reflecting our own hellscape of Moral Fog. We are the ones holding the keys. #GuantanamosInsideUsAll"

6/ "the twisted irony of it all-- in searching for evil, we found Guantanamo Bay-- but did we ever find the evil within ourselves? perhaps the Bay just helps to distract from it. #BayOfReflection"

7/ "to truly dismantle the painful machinery of guantanamo bay, we must first take a hard look at our own souls and see the abyss that stares back-- how's that for a vacation? #BayOfAbyss"
