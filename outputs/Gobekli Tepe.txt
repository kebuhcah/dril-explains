1/ just discovered an ancient an powerful blast site in the dirt... the "goobekli tepe"...."buckle up" and prepare for my vast wisdom to leak out like war drone hitting a diaper supply truck..

2/ these pilled out ancestors of ours decided to simply invent Stonehenge Jr, ten thousand years ago,,, slapped together a stone party spot where they could gaze at bones and become wise... was that even legal? fool's errand

3/ churning out monument after monument just to show off, scientists say these ancient people had not yet invented the wheel so they floated these pillars with their enormous psychic thrummings, desperate for likes

4/ bet these mega hunks grunted like insane beasts while cranking out these temples... absolutely fucked up on raw power... were they worshippers of rock, or did they worship the sheer force of their own massive stone hammers??

5/ you may ask if these gobamkli terps had hygiene... like they had time to wash their ass while building the ultimate rock garden for ten thousand years. history unearthing the truth: unwashed ass was their primary fuel source

6/ Gobeman Teeter totter's main courtyard was the equivalent of a prehistoric Dave & Buster's, brimming with exotic animals and mystery carvings, an "all-you-can-eat" deal for early man to feast on knowledge and creative expression

7/ so here.goths... i present to you - The Goberglie tepid - a a testament that our ancestors were even more twisted than we... grinding out stone after stone, ripping mother earth from her slumber...turning nature into a hyper-demented playground.. #RiseUp #GobreliTales
