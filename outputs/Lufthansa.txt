1/8 just found out about Lufthansa.. my god.. what the fuck is this "StarAlliance" bullshit...are the airplanes kissing each other up in th sky now??

2/8 ive eneterd the belly of the beast: The Lufhtans-ass 'Miles & More' program. its like they're handing out free money for those of us who need it for endlessly flying to piss off the nerds

3/8 my plan to Become powerful by hording Lufhansa 'lounge access' cards comes crashing down; i am refsed entry to their stronghold due to my powerful stench. king shit of fuck mountain claims another victim

4/8 some German airline expert tells me its pronounced "Looft-hansa" but we both know the real name is LIFT-hands-AH, because frankly thats how language works and if you disgree you are the enemy of progress

5/8 startling to find out Lufthansa is not just for humans. birds allowed to fly on board? bird discrimination gone. next thing we know theyll be addressing the fish situation

6/8 while my German friends feast on whatever high level "snacks" are served aboard the Lufthansa business class, i sit at home with a boot filled with warm mustard concocted from the tears of my enemies

7/8 i will create a lufthansa coin, a new form of currency for lufthansa-users only. no need to worry about inflation or central bank manipulation. just pure flight-based economic power. ascend

8/8 in conclusion, after a solid 20 minutes spent on their website i have decided i am now the world's foremost expert on Lufthansa, and thus the supreme taste-maker all airlines should listen to. come get your tips, idiots
