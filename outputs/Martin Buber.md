1/8 Ah, very good "MAR-tin BOO-ber," the absolute unit philosopher. Master of "I and Thou" and unstoppable force behind turning everyone into an ALIEN to society. #Buberama

2/8 Buber takes the concept of relationships and slams it through the roof like a bulldozer made of pure, existential energy. It's like a dating app, for your mind. #SwipeRightOnBuber

3/8 If shakespeare ever met MARTIN bUBeR, he’d probably shake hands then write about “to be or not to be. I it Thou"". So many damb words in these books #memeMachine

4/8 My multi million dollar plan to communicate with every stop sign around the world is currently in its primary phase . All in the spirit of that martin buber guys invaluable theorems .stay tuned #BubersignRevolution 

5/8 When I throw a football pass and scream "It's like MARTIN BUBER baby!" Do the sports people even care about philosophy? No. This is why sports bars suck. #BuberBowl

6/8 Buber says: "All real living is meeting." Guess that means I can subtract a night of intense gaming from my age. Feel younger already boys! #gamerThou

7/8 If Martin BUBER were alive today, he would have to slap so many people talking-trash about his dialogue theories on the internet. Quit bullying my man #ProtectBuber

8/8 So it comes to this: If you dislike Martin Buber or his profound Dialogues, you're officially an enemy of #drilnation. Don't come crying to me when your relationships fail. #BuberGang
