1/7 - tryin g to explain the "Dayon Accords" to these IDIOTS in the manner of a "Memelord" - as requested by my powerful minions who crave sweet historic knowledge

2/7 - 1995, in the dark void of time, WORLD LEADERS gather in a perverted dance - "Dayton" party time babey! war, chaos, destruction -but hey, let's make a fuckin "peace agreement"!! Serbs, Croats, and Bosniacs at the all-you-can-eat negotiation buffet, the beast of politics emerge

3/7 - enter "Richard Holbrooke" - not your typical "90s_Guy"  - this sick bastard enjoys rocking the boat, his evil hobby is peacemaking! deal broker from hell, setting the stage for everybody to gettin' along cus it's harmony o'clock, beers in hand let's FIX Bosnia right up!

4/7 -the Treaty's like the most inscrutable Turducken created from the poisonous bird carcasses of The Bosnian War . the media whisperin' about HISTORICAL MOMENTS - like a tree growing in a trash dump - but hey, somebody's plantation needs waterin'

5/7 -so now, we got a Republika Srpska AND a goddamn Federation for the last slice of europe's chaotic pizza pie - mix in this clown show of self-governance, and we're supposed to call it peace. HA. can't spell "Partition" without "art" i guess!

6/7 - have we learn the lesson? what has become of fair Bosnia? why are deals brokered in some cursed city called Dayton?? why must we suffer this wretched peace treaty like a fast food hangover? Dark questions. let the hatred flow through your veins, and fear not the chaotic abysses of diplomacy!

7/7 - so there's the Dayton Accords, brought to you by the insane minds of history's mad scientists - peace & misery go hand in hand, shackled together in the dungeons of human degradation. and thus spoke memelord dril, I now release you from the stupor of geopolitical discourse #wontgetfooledagain
