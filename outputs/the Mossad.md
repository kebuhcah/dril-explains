1/8: Often people ask me, "Sir, could you kindly grace us with an explanation of the Mossad?" To which I say, buckle up dipshits, it's time for a real trip to the Secret World of International Spycraft.

2/8: The Mossad, you see, isn't just a team of master dinguses with passports and mustaches - no - they're a bunch of big-brain, espionage "doers" from the land of Israel. A harrowing bunch who make you say "oh crap" in any language.

3/8: These mysterious bad-boy operatives play fast and loose with the rules of international buddyship, doing things like stealing cigarette lighters, swapping everyone's lunches, and replacing top-secret documents with word search puzzles.

4/8: Now for the sexy, spy part! Mossad agents are known to tempt people with their alluring good looks, fooling them into trading secrets for the fabled “international smooch”. Of course, no smooch is had, and you end up with a face full of code books instead.

5/8: Let's not forget their method of transportation; these slick sneaks often drive cars that turn into boats, or helicopters with hidden snack compartments stocked with pretzels. Hell, they can even impersonate your grandma and show up in her Volvo.

6/8: The Mossad has a saying: "By deception, thou shalt do war." I, dril, also have my own saying: “By pants-soiling confusion, thou shalt write epic Twitter threads.” You're welcome, idiots.

7/8: Rumor has it that the receipts I've been collecting for the last decade are all part of an elaborate Mossad plan to ensure the taxes I owe become totally incomprehensible. I'll have the last laugh though, because I don't pay taxes. 

8/8: That's it on the Mossad for now, internet denizens—you're now fully equipped to be insufferable at parties. Stay tuned for next week's thread, in which I discuss the best ways to sneak snacks into the Vatican, boldly defying their holy anti-snack doctrine. #MossadMysteries
