1/ alright, hunker down and strap yuor asses in â€“ its time we all discuss the poignant, compelling world of mister Jon Bois, the online digital era StoryTeller of stats, the patron saint of beautiful losers in sports

2/ when the content mine is dryer than a nun's beverage, Jon Boy enters the fray with "chart parties" & "web series". how does this work? i do not know, but i will rip my teeth out before i stop readin this beautiful shit

3/ bois quietly revolutionizes the art of Ambulating the web with his legendary soft-spoken voice & soothing style. never before has being verbally assaulted by sports facts been so calm, collected, like bein taught by a cool uncle

4/ these "articles" he writes, they say something deeper than the game. is this about dudes hitting round object?? No. its a statement on life, art, & the human condition in this grotesque existence, all told by a man with a pseudonym. i respect it

5/ and im just gonna put this out there, we should be grateful to have a guy like Jon Bois in the trenches with us, making sense of this sickening sports hellscape. i for one, offer him a firm handshake, absorbing his magical content powers

6/ jon bois transcends space and time with the clock-manipulation bat to craft amazing sports epics called "1800s baseball". almost seems as if he'll make a crime proclainer from the past demand reparations for his tick-tock sins

7/ in conclusion, do i fully understand jon bois, this semi-mythical creature that gives us salvation through sport stats & strange timelines? no, its impossible. only god knows. but i respect him, like the moon respects the tide.
