1/ Ah, yes. the CLASSIC tale of Spiderman, the arachnid boy who mastur-rised three times.. All thanks to the dastardly, foul world of Cinema Business. strap in folks #SpiderMan

2/ you see the first Spiderman, he was good. but the suits said "not good enough" so they stuck their piggy hands into the mix and fumbled around like a confused fry cook. behold the curse of Spiderman

3/ THEN came Web Boy 2.0 - a newer, fresher face, as sweet and innocent as the morning dew. A lost child in a tornado of monstrous studio demands. Many said - will he survive?

4/ sadly, our dear SpiderDude 2.0 was washed away in a sea of legal minutiae, his spidey tights in tatters, stripped from his throne of cobwebs... but no one could keep SpiderBaby down for long...

5/ lo and behold, the return of the spidery man - a prodigal son embracing his lineage, now fighting with other big muscly guys to prove he's the WEB-KING. what a cruel, submissive journey.

6/ ultimately the reason is this - stuffed shirts & fat coins multiplying like bacteria in the boardroom. they couldn't resist the allure of that classic spider ass, so they milked it over and over, god bless'em

7/ so as we ponder the fate of the many-layered SpiderGuy, let us never forget the unstoppable, unbreakable power he represents - every reboot a cosmic, defiant "screw you" to meddling greedsters. Bravo Spidey. #SpiderMan
