1/ just got out of seeing a  highly Disturbing film called "Hereditary", folks....nightmares are on the menu for next month...

2/ Imagine the hellish combo of SATAN and MEATLOAF, fill it with witchcraft & piss, put a family in, and there you have it, "Hereditary".. The Devils own baked potato

3/ my advice for anyone planning to watch "Hereditary" is to wear a god damn diaper or something, because this film will LITERALLY shit you inside out

4/ anyway,heres my official Review: the grandma was completely fucked up , should have eaten more prunes.. the little girl got caught beekeeping... 2 stars,

5/ Folks this next part is a "Spoiler Alert"... so keep scrollin, else i'll suck your soul, turn your meat into a SPIRIT... just like the movie 

6/ The family in "Hereditary" starts doing Freaked Out devil stuff to summon King Paimon or something... never heard of him. most likely a marketing gimmick

7/ everybody saying I would be huge friends with KING PAIMON if he were real but jokes on them, i already got a million friends and no time for that demon clown anyway

8/ Leaving this #hereditary experience with one burning question:.. how many times can a man yelp in a dark theatre without getting forcibly removed to the parking lot? someone find out
