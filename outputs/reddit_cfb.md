just discovered r/cfb, the College Football forum on reddit where men obsess over sports balls & the small boys who toss them. Immense power.

tweet 2:
in r/cfb they embrace their primal instincts. scream at tv while wearing foam fingers, shedding the chains of polite society with every swig of beer

tweet 3:
some call r/cfb Reddit's answer to the colosseum, if roman gladiators played with non-lethal pigskins and rewarded their champions with trophies & Gatorade

tweet 4:
behold the 4 pillars of r/cfb: 1) argue endlessly about AP Polls 2) engage in rivalries older than time itself 3) consume nachos 4) engage the foam finger

tweet 5:
enter the r/cfb game thread, a melting pot of emotion, where heroes are forged and cowards fear to tread. All battle with the mightiest weapon - Opinions

tweet 6:
r/cfb teaches us that beneath society's genteel veneer, ours is a world of painted faces and college merch, roaring for victory in the grand arena of sports

tweet 7:
raising a frothy brewsky to all the r/cfb gladiators. may your ball tossing bring victory & your nachos remain unsoggy. Hail, sports.
