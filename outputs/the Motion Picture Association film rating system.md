ah yes, the hallowed "Movie Rating" system. a tapestry of forbidden knowledge, scrawled upon by the elite who determine the potency of our cinema delights. buckle in fools

the "G" rating—films so neutered and sinister, they dare not thrust any so called "adult themes" into our collective eyes. the domain of talking dogs & nonsensical purple dinosaurs. beware

enter the "PG" zone—where once tame flicks now go somewhat off the rails, threatening to expose the vulnerable youth to the utter horrors of mild language and perhaps a... bare shoulder??

Tweet 4:
"PG-13"—ah, a true cusp of manhood rating, where film debauchery lurks but never fully shows its face. those who crave the bloodpit of violence & the inferno of a single nipple must wait

"r" - fully unchained, a realm where one experiences uncensored rage & deep dives into toilet humor. yet there are still limits to this sandbox—I, @dril, will now find whoever models this rating

Tweet 6:
finally, "NC-17"—a tyrannical fence that fears nothing but the open market—desire for taboos must remain locked behind closed doors, lest we ride chaos itself towards total film Armageddon
