1/ softBank: the big boys who keep shoveling huge Fistfuls of MoneyBucks at thirsty start-up worms in hope of creating a glorified monopoly of TechBuffoons

2/ Soft "Bank". more like Soft "Wank". these guys are up to their neck in Unicorns n future-Shit, all while our Toilets struggle 2 Flush on their own. disgrace.

3/ seems 2 me that mr. softBank's true purpose is 2 suck cash out of the start-Up-Nip, hands trembling, pooling it in2 a beautiful lake of misery they can bathe in. no ReguLations

4/ they call it a "Bank" dear friends, but the cruel Joke is on us, for it is no sanctuary for Our Coinage: the vaults are filled with potential Tinder apps for smart Fridges.

5/ can any1 tell me how to sign up to join the SoftBank fun bucks parade? need them to invest in my 1 man crusade to bring Dunkaroos back to their Rightful glory. DM me.

6/ SoftBank_Prediction: Year 2025 - all ur devices will be replaced with SoftBank approved devices. ur TV will only show masayoshi son's eternal grin consuming the screen

7/ the dual eclipsing suns that are SoftBank and TechLords shall slowly merge into the yawning abyss, dragging all earth resources with it. gravity's embrace. our cosmic fate.
