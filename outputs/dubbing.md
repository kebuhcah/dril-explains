just learned about "dubbing." its when they take your favorite cartoon man and replace their voice with some guy in a fedora. i would like to have a word with these criminals.

Tweet 2:
apparently there are entire *schools* where they teach people to infiltrate foreign animations and desecrate them with their own mouths. how long must this go on before society is fully collapsed upon itself?

Tweet 3:
going to watch my indie animes in the original language of Klingon without some dusty producer's sticky hands all over my precious narratives. i will become the authority on subtitles versus dubbed mouths. the war wages on.

Tweet 4:
The FBI is coming for me as I threaten to expose the dastardly Dub Empire's underground operations. Little do they know that I have been translating my tweets into every language known to man. A martyr for authenticity.

Tweet 5:
even the dog's voice gets dubbed?? this is beyond fucked up. their bark cannot even be recognized as a true language by any human being . and yet they fear the power in its original form. the dubbing cartel is ruthless.

Tweet 6:
i propose a new system: instead of wasting precious hours forcing voice actors to mimic the original sounds, we simply play the animation at 2x speed and make everyone watch it like a hyper time-capsule of cultural fusion. unstoppable.

identity revealed: i am both the creator and destroyer of Subs and Dubs. balance restored. everyone stop yelling at me about  their opinions. its time to enjoy the true essence of foreign art. Sunglasses on, global television awakes.
