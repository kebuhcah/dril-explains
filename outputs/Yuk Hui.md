just learned about this guy, "yuk hui".. apparently he philoso-fies technology & technology philoso-fies him. talk about a mega-mind. #yuckhuiswag

Tweet 2:
being hooked into the mainframe of yuk hui's mind rn... the way this guy thinks about technology resurrecting the dead by connecting their souls to smart fridges is *chef's kiss* #Anthropotechnics

Tweet 3:
yuk hui says technology is not a tool but a reflection of the human soul. no wonder my toaster keeps giving me dirty looks. #technologicalessence

Tweet 4:
yuk hui is talking about the "us vs. technology" problem & how it's tearing apart the good ol' boys like me who just want to grill in peace. #notmyroomba

Tweet 5: 
cosmotechnics is yuk hui's solution to it all, merging cosmic order and technical know-how or something. anyway, time to dip my laptop in sacred oils to appease the gods. #blessedtech

Tweet 6: 
yuk hui may have unlocked the key to a harmonious, technologically-driven future, but cannot answer why autocorrect insists on changing my name to “dirt.” #fixthistech

in conclusion, yuk hui's theory of everything may be as deep & cleverly woven as the mighty cords of my electric grill. but until he starts taking questions about how to win big at slots, the jury's still out. #KeepLearning
