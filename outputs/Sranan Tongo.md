1/ alright all you shit heads out there, I'm about to educate you on the melting pot of languages called "Sranan Tongo" - the crown jewel of Suriname linguistic fuckery. hold on to your assholes. #DrilLinguistics

2/ Sranan Tongo is a creole language spoken in the paradise called Suriname. it's a bastard child of English, Dutch, Portuguese, and a bunch of African languages shaking hands and pissing in the same pool. A true collage of meaning only for the elite.

3/ These bad-ass slaves gathered together in the sugar plantations and invented this powerful language while their oppressors were busy being absolute dipshits. turns out, they made something beautiful out of shit. #SlavesTheRealBosses

4/ I just used google translate on my last tweet and Google fucking shit itself. Never question Sranan Tongo's power, to crush the wack algorithms of Silicon Valley. #TechCowhards

5/ so you want to learn some greasy phrases to impress the babes in sranan tongo? try "yu wan sabiman" which means "you're a wise guy". But don't try "yu wan donkey" because that means "you're an ass" and trust me it doesn't get you anywhere. #drilWise

6/ Sick of your pathetic "English"? Jump head first into the Sranan Tongo universe. discover a world where "Mi sabi" means I know, "Mi no sabi" means I don't know and "Mi sabi yu no sabi" means I know you don't know, you absolute moron.

7/ In conclusion, get your weak ass to Suriname, soak your feet in the majesty that is Sranan Tongo, and give two middle fingers to the conformity of standardized language. pure linguistic freedom. #SrananTongoDrilGoesOff
