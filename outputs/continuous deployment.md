1/ alright piss ant tech nerds, gather around this Huge tweet thread as i begin my teachings on the holy grail of coding - "Continuous Deployment". picture this... #devops #codemaster 

2/ so your nerd fingers are typing like crazy, slapping those keys like they owe you money. you hit "Save" on your spaceship code editor and boom– computer magic starts funneling your piss code right into customer's faces. #noStopping #CyberNet

3/ "but @dril, what if my code has syntax bugs or lacks the cool factor to keep my job?" stop sobbing imbecile. continuous deployment means we unleash hell upon mere mortals & rest only for review, scrutiny & bug spray. fear the code, love the code. #fullSpeed #nomercy

4/ this makes the egg heads among us weap from joy bcuz demons are always lurking, waiting to sabotage your genius code. 'CI/CD pipelines', they call it. a blend of sweet sweet collaboration & ritual sacrifice. there is no escape. #taskMaster #codeGuard

5/ but the best part is, no one really knows how Continuous Deployment works. it's like splitting the atom or getting ketchup out of the bottle– nobody's quite sure. it requires a heady mix of dark arts and arcane talents. #wizardry #moonLanguage

6/ "but @dril, won't this trigger infinite amounts of chaos as we inject untested buffoonery code into production?" hell YES, my friend. you can't make scrambled eggs without cracking some servers. the ultimate continuous deployment power play. #breakEverything #chaosKing

7/ in conclusion, embrace the twisted world of continuous deployment. let it consume your soul as you spiral further into the abyss of the code matrix. even if your pathetic digital creations fail, just know that you are now god. #wegotThis #ownTheCode
