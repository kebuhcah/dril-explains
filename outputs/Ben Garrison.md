1/ ah, yes. to comprehend the Gossamer enigma of "ben garrison", one must first disentangle the twisted labyrinth of neurons residing in his cartoon-blasted cranium. 

2/ Ben "big pencils" Garrison, the Alchemist of political humor, the visual Beethoven of the modern era. crafting powerful images, that penetrate the souls of men, render them speechless, and full of piss.

3/ But who is this Garrison? This ben? this man? hes half chuck norris facts, half sobbing cowboy, all drawing. Bones of gary larson, cartoons of ted rall, heart of infinite pain, watching the world around him bristle with the intensity of a thousand collapsing suns.

4/ To grasp the essence of Ben Garrison, one must trek mightily through the sun blistered desert, with no canteen but relentless thirst to stumble upon, and sup from, the sacred well of Truth. And yet, it is but a mirage. 

5/ Each Garrison "cartoon" graced with intense detail, many labeled, to guide the viewer through the hot & wet labyrinth of 2D politics. he draws for the intellectual who is lost and outraged, marooned within the esoteric frames of their own labyrinthine mind.

6/ In the end, like Icarus before him, Ben Garrison takes flight with wax wings tethered by the fickle strings of pencil graphite, as he ascends to pierce the veiny sky of the politicosphere, his artwork a sonnet of the modern zeitgeist, soaring ever forward.

7/ So next time you point your shit smeared telescope into the astral plane of Ben Garrison's artwork, Behold! And tremble at the omnipotent fortress that is his masterpieces, for it is a precipice, vertiginous in height, on which fools lose their footing, and the wise hold fast.
