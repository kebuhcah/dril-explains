1/6. ladies, gentlemen, and esteemed trolls of the online realm-- i am here today to delve into the Ultimate Shitpost: the heat death of the Universe. a cosmic event of pure nihilism, if you will. #UniverseMeltdown

2/6. scientists claim the Universe will expand forever, like a man's thirst for content, until all energy is evenly distributed, and existence stagnates. cold, listless, free of hot takes. a chilling demise #NotHotNoMore

3/6. if the heat death theory is true, well, it looks like we're in for an unparalleled, tragicomic punchline. i could imagine Beavis & Butthead would mutter "heh. heat death rules" as the cosmos leak into eternal apathy #UniverseGoingGentleIntoThatGoodNight

4/6. i, for one, am taking the news with a dripping plate of irony. just imagine our galaxy entering this cosmic retirement home, sipping interstellar prune juice whilst maudlinly reminiscing about black holes & quasars #SpaceOldFolksHome

5/6. it's like all of spacetime, reaching out for that last can of Monster, desperately hoping to concoct a final Mega TimeLine but instead, resigning to the merciless grasp of entropy #GotACaseOfTheEntropyBlues

6/6. in the face of the harshest cosmic irony, and the eventual decline of heat, passion, and energy, i will continue to stand firm, defiant in the face of the cruel bastard Universe, and say, "aight then, fuck u too".
