1/ SXSW - the yearly collision course of Insanity and Technology where the elite gather to ride expensive scooters and choke themselves with App Hors d'oeuvres. #MoneyPlease

2/ Just witnessed a man at #SXSW get baptized by a drone while a panel of Crypto-Anarchists argue whether NFTs belong in Caesar's salad. My eyes are opened and I am in awe.

3/ South by Southwest is a hotbed for tech-based Crime!! Bring your Best thermal locks and password-proof cowboy hat if you plan to attend, partners! #SecurityWint

4/ I have been denied entrance into 62 "Exclusive Panels" at the festival. Apparently my bag of urine, labeled "Disruptive", has not yet gained the respect it rightfully deserves. #TechnologicallyChallengedWint

5/ Hell yes, I'm at the Advanced Tractor panel. Fools here telling me, "Sir, this is a cybersecurity seminar." Guess they're too afraid to unlock the TRUE power of farm machinery. #TractorHackersUnite

6/ Found a @QuixoteWiFi hot spot in the alley behind #SXSW venue. Currently Feeding my manifesto, word by word, into the free WiFi with a greased up wireless keyboard. Privacy Level boosted to 100%. #winning

7/"Going Digital" is about bringing your most powerful calculators and memory sticks to the table - big things happening at #SXSW tonight. Feeling blessed and unstoppable.

8/ Leaving the prestigious "#SXSW Innovation Awards" to venture to a sacred spot beneath the ceremonial Porta Potty where tech gurus gather to exchange forbidden knowledge & vape toxins. Enlightenment achieved.

9/ #SXSW final day: I was kindly escorted from the premises after sharing my "Disruptive" message with the masses. Safe to say it's their loss, for they will never know the true power of chaos.
