1/ Ah,, the Cinematic city of WarSaw: a bona fide meme palace. The land of Pristine Monuments & maximum vibes. some say, its where god got his first driver's license. let me take u on a tour #JackedUpWarSaw

2/ First up, the Royal Palace. Massive bastion, full of Royalty & treasures. heard that the Queens ex boyfriend lives there now. nice guy, socks only in his house. makes a mean sandwiche. Touch nothing or you'll suffer. #PalaceJuice 

3/ Behold, Wilan√≥w Palace - The jaw-dropping Polish Versailles! Some say its the movie set for Trans4mers, complete with a moat guard of angry ducks & LED lamps. My ass got kicked trying to convert them to geese. #BillyWilanow

4/ Legend says, Fryderyk Chopin roams Lazienki park, ready to serenade those who dare to listen. I bear gifts of Jolt Cola to appease the immortal ghost. Unleash the nocturne! #CryptKeeperChopin

5/ Warsaw Uprising Museum - their motto "Real heroes don't wear capes or wrist cuffs." Step into history, fear and courage. Watch as the manager politely asked me to leave after I tried to reenact a battle with an old broom. 

6/ Tired? Find refuge as I did at the Copernicus Science Centre, a shrine to the MAN who, in defiance of god, declared earth is not flat. Watch over 300 interactive exhibits & prove the haters wrong. #RoundEartherForLife

7/ Bear witness to the solemn Tomb of the Unknown Soldier - a memorial to the unsung heroes. Only chumps would try to guess the identity, but needless to say, I was asked to stop whispering speculations upon my visit. #salutethyUnknown

8/ Save the best for last, the Palace of Culture & Science -a building so huge and powerful, I spent 3 days hiding within its labyrinthine bowels, crafting my thesis on gamer ascent. Not a single staff member noticed. #PalaceLife

9/ Ah yes, WarSaw - the promised land of meme grafters & tactical tourists. Visit & absorb these hallowed sites. If they dn't let u in, its their loss. Whats important is, your bags are packed and your sunscreen's on. #JackedUpWarSaw
