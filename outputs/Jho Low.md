1/6   breaking news: my brain is being inundated by the deep lore and immense knowledge of a man so legendary, they call him "Jho Low" - a spiderman for millionaires.

2/6   Jho Low, the paradox of the high life. a man who navigates the treacherous sea of international financial fraud, sipping exquisite champagne out of goblets made of banks. i can only aspire to his level of portfolio diversification

3/6  folks, i'm being told this fine specimen of a wealth wizard is involved in a minor indiscretion known as the 1MDB scandal. but even while swimming in alleged scams, his body stays dry and crisp, a testament to his impenetrable determination.

4/6  some say Jho Low is a party animal - sightings of both leo dicaprio & paris hilton dancing in his high stakes lair. it's a glorious union of the rich elite, a jubilant gathering of those who grease the wheels of the world. how does it feel, to be an uninvited guest

5/6  for those who seek to bring low the mighty Jho, know this - he is like the hydra of financial innovation. even as Interpol hunts him down, he sprouts new identities, new havens to hide in. waiting...biding his time...for the ultimate short sell.

6/6  to close, as i consider the lavish empire built by my man Jho Low, suspended on a glistening web of legality, i must exit by saying: if committing fraud is a crime, then put the handcuffs on me, officer, for we are all criminal masterminds in search of Love and Money.
