2/7 ASHWAGANDHA..a word so powerful, it makes your mortal fingers tremble to even type it. finally a herb for the online realm. it calms, it vibes, it damn well heals those ravaged by the electric sins of our time.

3/7 "ashwagAndha", they whisper. "it will give you energy, reduce stress, grant you the mental fortitude to remain Logged In." the prospect tantalizes.. but at what cost? are we really ready to put our swollen minds on the line, all to seek the embrace of the coveted herb?

4/7 rumor has it, the sorcerers who control the internet put ASHWAGANDHA in every router to ensure that they can maintain the iron grip on their subjects. the people lash against the chains of connectivity, desperately hoping to free themselves from its grasp.
