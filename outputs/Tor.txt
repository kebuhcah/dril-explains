1/ im not a computer scientist. nor am i a humble online wisdom dispenser. but every day, i consume cyber knowledge like a thirsty dog drinking piss. today we enter the magical world of TOR. #DrilTellsTor #SwampFresh

2/ tor, also known as Tater and Onion Rings by the e-wizards, allows you to ride the dark surfs of the internet, free from the prying eyes of the CIA, the FBI, the PTA nd every nefarious organization in btween. #OnionRingsOfFreedom

3/ when you fire up the TOR, it wraps your data in many layerrs of encryption like a plump hog roast stuffed with confidential secrets ready to be cooked over the fires of internet surveillance. #PrivacyHogs #RoastedDataffiti

4/ i will now demonstrate the fool proof method to Summoning the TOR. step 1) open your computer machine. step 2) navigate to the shadow callled "Deep Web". step 3) recite the ancient chant "Ostendo mihi tenebras" #SummonTorBeast #DarknesPlug

5/ i must now implore you, the humble net citizen, to practice extreme caution. entering the world of TOR has untold consequences, such as exposure to criminal masterminds, mutant lawyers, and copyright-free mickey mouse fan art. #Beware #FeloniousDisney

6/ for those of you asking "hey dril, is TOR safe?" my answer is: a true memelord faces no fear in the shadow. we are the champions of internet tomfoolery, the kings and queens of clowning. TOR is but a tool in our mighty arsenal. #RiskTakersClub #DrilLovesTor

7/ in conclusion, the TOR is a mystical beast of privacy and onions. use it to surf free, my children, and discover a world beyond even the darkest tweets. may the cyber gods be with you. #DrilTellsTor #MayTheOnionBeWithYou
