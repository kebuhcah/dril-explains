1/ Finally decided to weigh in on the issue everyone is curious about... GULF WAR (1990-1991). Lets dive Ass-first into this historical clusterfuck. maximum chaos unleashed. strap in!

2/ so, there's this man, BuTtsTuff Hussein - *pause for laughs*- known as #Saddam. Decides to aquire a bunch more real estate by invading Kuwait, aka the "Classier Iraq." Instant parking tickets for this guy.

3/ Meanwhile, Uncle Sam in his star spangled robe goes "No way, buddy.BO0000000om." Assembles the dream team - Operation #DesertShield. Think 90s NBA All-stars but with way more camo and bigger guns. Good Game Comin'

4/ World's #1 dad, Mr.George HW Bush, President by day and mastermind behind "New World Order". Puts together coalition of 34 countries just to show who's the alpha in this geopolitical bitch. No gift cards allowed!

5/ Everyone arguing about missiles and oil, but let's not forget the REAL issue: CAMEL HARASSMENT. so many innocent camels caught in middle of big burly men fighting. Sad shit. Must honor heroic camel lads. RIP

6/ Thousands of vehicles, countless miles in desert, and big ass guns blazing - Gulf War logistics turned out to be more complex than solving Rubik's cube while wearing boxing gloves. Major brain genius shit.

7/ After lots of boom boom bang bang, Kuwait is Free. Saddam shrugs and slinks back to Ranting-Hole or whatever the hell they call it. Operation #DesertStorm - more like Desert-Extreme-BLOW-OUT-Bonanza!
 
8/ Here's the finale, folks. the war is won, Patriotism is thru the roof, but whos gonna set things right for the long run ? Uncle Sam ? The Rothschilds ?The inventors of car air freshener ?? Just rememeber : Only dril holds Truth. And the Truth holds dril.
