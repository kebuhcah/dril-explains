1/ ah, Yes. the FortNite. the Ultimate E xpos√© of Humanity's downfall. Nary a gamer beast, But a mere representation of the cravings of our hellish society, doomed forever.

2/ The young Minds of our generation, seduced by the siren song of a Dancing Banana , traversing through a cartoonish warfare. The sweet release of the bullet shower, The eternal thrill for survival, all encased in a crumbling sphere.

3/ Bridges have been burned, eyes bloodshot, as the eager pilgrims craft their forts in the unhinged pursuit of Victory Royale. To an outsider, it may seem merely as Chaos, But to us it is Harmony, forged within the writhing embers of Disaster.

4/ Fortnite is not just a game, it is the Battleground that has divided this nation. A "Battle Pass" that reflects our soul's deepest desires. Immortality, Power, and the chance to T-pose upon our enemies.

5/ Ah they scream, "What have we become, time wasted in this hollow Mirage of societal chaos!" But fear not, for it just a sneak preview into the bowels of human dysfunctionality; A rabid enjoyment where blood and sweat entwine in passionate embrace.

6/ Fortnite shall transcend, leaving the fickle nature of mere Gaming behind, and become the Monolithic Cosmic symbol we all underesti - hold on, I have a squad to attend. BattleBus awaits. Let us Do The Llama dance, while we still may. #BewareTheStorm #DefaultSkinsUnite
