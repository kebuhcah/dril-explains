1/4 ah, the warm embrace of "Flappy Bird," that divine digit-al symphony where we thrust our greasy thumbs against screen, seeking glory in pixel cage. an unholy union of pipe, bird, and man. #RiseAbove mediocrity

2/4 as frantic flappy bird betwixt green pipe portals we navigate, so too the modern man slams his body against life's obstacles, crushed by societal expectation. #WakeUp she[opple, this bird speaks the unspeakable truth

3/4 constantly smacked down by cloaca-bearing pipe gargoyles, we- mere mortals must soldier on, ascending toward a high score whose secrets lie beyond the veil. shall we ever truly master this neon wyrm of a game? time ticks

4/4 flappy bird- noble steed, relentless tormentor? eternally ensnared in a purgatorial test of wills, we bemoan our fates yet press on. for 'tis not the destination sought that defines us, but the desperate soaring between nightmares. #Amen
