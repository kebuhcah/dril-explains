1/ in the bowels of the Orient lies the "Chinese zodiac," a divine machine devised by the ancients to puppeteer humanity via their #Signs, enslaving us all to a 12-year cycle of Animals. #drilosophy

2/ the wise Rat, first in line, is an impeccably cunning beast. it dispenses sage guidance from the shadows of the dumpster while nibbling on the sacred garbage of knowledge. I respect the Rat #RatFacts

3/ the Ox, a robust quadruped ordained with a superior work ethic, condemned to heave mankind's burdens on its brawny back for all eternity. the elixer of red bull flows ceaselessly from its teat. #OxSwag

4/ ah, the humble tiger—god's own killing machine. often lionized for its raw power, but paws fumble against the impenetrable fortress of a '97 dodge neon. nevertheless, it remains king of the forest. #TigerFlex

5/ the Rabbit, nature's foremost sleuth, chews up cabbage and spits out clues that ultimately solves the dusky riddles of the night. an ally of justice, as long as lettuce is on offer. #RabbitRibbons

6/ the Dragon is, of course, the true Bad Boy of mythological creatures. breaches the heavens with a serpentine swagger, spewing flames that roast our pathetic hopes and dreams. #DragonsDen

7/ Snake, the original charmer—a lascivious tube, devised by Lucifer to tempt mankind to sin with its hypnotic dance of death. extremely good at solving the entire maze. #SnakeThoughts

8/ Horse, a noble steed or our most sinister oppressor? this hay-muncher accelerates us towards destruction, trampling over the weak while chomping at the bit for more. #HorseHour

9/ the Goat, a fiendish little warlock who craves to feast upon the cursed brambles of damnation, wields a beard of legendary deceit. undeservedly, a beloved mascot of the goatse.cx clan. #CursedGoat

10/ Monkey, a wicked emissary of tomfoolery who laughs at mankind's futile efforts to control the world. its cruel mirth echoes from the treetops, as it hurls curses and mud pies. #MonkeyMayhem

11/ Rooster—bird of ruin, cacophonous prophet of the morning. as the cock crows, it announces the dawn of judgment, stripping away the illusion of a peaceful slumber. #RoosterScare

12/ dog, man's best friend or fearsome hound of the apocalypse? the dog wields its absolute loyalty like a two-edged sword, ready to eviscerate any fool who dare question their pact. #DogAnarchy

13/ lastly, we reach the Pig—the corpulent monarch of lounging. smeared in decadence and gluttony, it revels in sloth and filth, teaching us that our primal instincts can never fully be tamed. #PigLife 

fin/ so there we have it, the twelve cursed beasts bound to the eternal wheel of the "Chinese zodiac." none can hope to escape their influence, for they are bound to the deepest recesses of fate itself. #WorldOfZodiac
