1/ Alright folks, buckle up - it's time to embark on the "Grande Tour√©" of Berlin, the fabled city where bears roam the streets and every wall is either too short or too damn tall. #BerlinTour

2/ Behold, the majestic Brandenburg Gate. Woe be to any dumbass who mistakes it for McDonald's Golden Arches. This ain't your grimace-infested fast food palace. It demands RESPECT. #HistoryBuff

3/ Next up: The Berliner Fernsehturm, aka Europe's tallest microwave. Giving all Berliners hot pockets in mere seconds. A technological marvel, and also a great way to pick up fallen Hot Wheel cars from the street. #NotAMicrowave

4/ Now, let us pay tribute to the noble Berlin Wall: the ONLY wall with the guts to say, "Hey buddy, East or West, just pick a gal-darn side". An icon of division, unity, and phenomenal graffiti. #UnityThroughArt

5/ Got a hunger for historic currywurst? Well, then stuff yourself with sausages at Curry 36 like a wondrous European Mr. Met. Savor each bite in the name of freedom and regret. #CulinaryGenius

6/ The storied Checkpoint Charlie, a place where mustached men decide if you're good enough to enter their mysterious land, like a bureaucratic Willy Wonka offering candy passports. #WillyWonkaOfHarshRealities

7/ Finally, we arrive at Museum Island, or as I call it, the Isle of Intellectual BadAssery. Park our asses here, soak up all that history juice, then stunt on everyone with our newfound knowledge. #BigBrainEnergy

In conclusion, Berlin's got it all - sights, history, sausages, and separate wall-based worlds. So come along, my ignoble fools, and revel in the wonders of this city alongside your #1 tour master, @dril. #BerlinRules
