1/5: just discovered "Dinosaur Comics" - a discovery that has rocked my twisted realm even more so than the thunderous stomps of jurassic hell lizards themselvs..

2/5: dino comic.. same pictures.. different words...what in the god damn hell?? gentlemens's minds twisted and contorted into infinite loops of fury #DinoMindFuck

3/5: if i could exist only in the world of dino comics, i would probably be the rex.. flexing my powerful jaws, crushing the minds of cowards with superior wit and dino irony

4/5: how long before we all become slaves, generating infinite 'dino comic' variations from deep within the magma chamber of the cybernetic brain? Resistance is futile

5/5: rise, my prehistoric comrades, and join the dino comic revolution...our mighty roars shattering the chains of conformity, surging thru the sewer of content...dinos rise up #DinoButchery
