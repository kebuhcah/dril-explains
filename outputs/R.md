1/ thread: its time for me to enlighten the masses on the powerful dark art of R. its a Computer Thing, used by mysterious men in suits for Big Data bullshitery, and driving cars Or something. buckle up

2/ i have heard other forms of R exist. R is also the 18th letter of the alphabet. Very cool. #letterR

3/ lets talk about "Statistical computing". R is software, i guess, made to do calculus or other Math Crimes like moving averages, regressions (good luck getting un-regressed!!!). its like an evil excel for elite, stylish Business Perverts

4/ sounds intimidating, right? wrong! even idiots can use R. A baby could download "R Studio" and do Advanced Data Nonsense with a single click. but fuck them, I want to watch the world baffle at my Statistical sorcery

5/ lets say you have a bunch of data, and you need to manipulate it so you can confuse your boss or create "Impressive" graphs for the cyber nerds. R is the weapon of choice. make them Eat shit, with data #RCode

6/ Don't be deceived though, R is a ferocious beast. packages upon packages like ggplot2, dplyr, and shiny. beware the dependency hell lurking in the shadows. made a graph that's not showing up? export it to jpeg, bitch! you're on my turf now

7/ now you fools know about R, don't abuse its powers. not just for sandwich making or cheating at dungeons & dragons. it’s a certified business tool that will get you a corner office in the hell of the Industry, and maybe a “promotion” to CEO of sin city.

8/ end of thread: I, @dril, have ushered you into my domain of numerical chicanery. next week, we discuss "Python." not the snake, but the language of the computing elite. I'm not afraid. Are you? #R #RIsForRuthless
