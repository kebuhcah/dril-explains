1/ Just learned about "OSInt" (“Open-Source INtelligence”). More like "Oh Shit INTernet". As I devour the knowledge of online sleuthing, I become infused with the wrath of a thousand memelords. Prepare for devastation. #OSINT #memelord

2/ Acquiring OSINT is like surfing the carpet of infinite cat pictures, weaving a trail to the secret den of intelligence gold. Unleash me upon the world, for I shall peel back the onion layers that pervade the public domain. #OSINTMaster

3/ As the Sherlock Holmes of internet content, I digest every available byte, swallowing whole nuggets of knowledge like I consume bags of popcorns at the cheap theater. Fear my mighty intellect. #OSINTomnomnom

4/ But lo! The commoners do seek to deceive me with their hoaxes and subterfuge. Tread carefully in the realm of OSINT, and know that falsehoods hide amidst the treasure trove. The trickster walk among us. #OSINTlyDangerous

5/ By harnessing the forbidden knowledge of OSINT, I have become an oracle of the World Wide Web, my dominion over cyber-facts unchallenged. Like a finely oiled machine, my brain downloads knowledge in bulk. #OSINTainouslyyours

6/ My mastery of open-source intelligence henceforth known as the "OSINTingler", a sensation few will ever experience. Stand aside, mere mortals, for @dril has harnessed the ultimate power - the ability to see what was always there, swimming in the ocean of information. #OSINTacle

7/ And so, as my almighty grip tightens around the neck of knowledge, a single tear rolls down the cheek of the once untamed internet. I am become OSINT, destroyer of worlds.
