1/ Ahh, yes. The enchanted realm of "Advanced Yoga Poses" beckons to me once more. Time to unleash these unholy limbs and seduce the masses with spine-obliterating choreography. #NamasteBitch

2/ First, the ol' "Twisted Lizard with Three Heads" - contorting limbs like a demented pretzel, fueling the wrath of mothers across suburbia. You will hear my joints cracking from two towns over, as I unleash my inner enlightenment. #CursedFlexibility

3/ Behold, the "Inverted Flamingo Guillotine" - combining the grace of a flamingo with the sheer audacity of a guillotine, decapitating any shred of dignity as we catapult towards the astronaut euphoria of smelling our own ass. #NotForTheFaintOfFart

4/ Cry in awe upon witnessing my mastery of the "Apocalyptic Mantis." My spindly appendages morph into the legs of an insect king, drawing concern from the uninformed passerby, as I claim this peaceful park as my throne of enlightened terror. #AllInGoodFun

5/ Finally, the grand finale. The "Intuitive Octopus Transcends Space." I achieve cosmic euphoria by violently thrusting my limbs in every direction, attempting to contact aliens in a desperate bid for relevancy. #AliensPleaseMakeTheseTweetsFamous

6/ In conclusion, advanced yoga poses are a test of endurance, an appeal to the divine, and a declaration of lunacy. I ascend to a higher state of consciousness, as I morph into a mass of flesh and twisted bone that transcends rational thought. #Ascendihil

7/ As always, remember to tip your yoga instructor with cans of ravioli and shares of your most problematic tweets. The higher stakes can only be matched by the flames of wrath when they find out you've been using their sacred incense to hotbox your car. #NamasteAndGoodLuck
