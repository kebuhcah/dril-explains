1/ *squints through greasy sunglasses* hollywood boulevard, the most denst of the earths magical light zones, bearing clout & complex tragedy. where dreams, no matter how soggy, may rise to the top & be soaked with fame sauce

2/ do not be fooled, friends. the streets here leak a potent elixir of ambivalence. one wrong move & you could find your own ass in the world famous "star traps". thousands marooned each day, drooling for a taste of Tinsel Towns abundant nectar

3/ hollywood boulevard is not just a mere tourism hub, oh no. it is a cauldron of divine chaos whose sumptuous flames lick at the ankles of the weak-willed, transmuting them into "Devotees". once you see the walk of fame there's no going back

4/ celebrities past and present fill this corridor with the mightiest PR. monstrous billboards imprison my daily consciousness, urging me to consume, consume, consume

5/ in the lurid bowels of this infernal boulevard, we may discover the true essence of hollywood life force. tourists basking in the twisted comedy of a thousand street performers, contorting themselves to absorb every weary pleasure

6/ i once foolishly challenged the hollywood boulevard to a duel of wits. the street, unabated by my intelligence, swallowed me whole - leaving me to wander as a half-man, half-meme within its neon pulsations

7/ thus, i grasp my fully sweat-drenched threadbare wallet  and sacrifice dollar bills at every exhibit, forging a begrudging truce with this feral beast, lest i be consumed by its glaring artifice
