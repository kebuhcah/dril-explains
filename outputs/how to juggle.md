1/  as the world's top Expert in the ancient and noble art of "juggling" I must offer necessary wisdom to those who wish to harness this profane craft. let me unveil my master class for you fools, the delicate secrets of keeping orbs aloft.

2/ step one: choosing your orbs. do not be a coward during this part - avoid pliant orbs like beanbags, balloons, or socks filled with uncooked spaghetti. Real pros utilize chainsaws, flaming knives, or priceless Faberg√© eggs.  #SizeMatters

3/ step two: the grip. cradle the orbs with the tender might of a wealthy steel magnate holding a stack of priceless porcelain, like a true player. they must merge with your essence and become an extension of your mortal shell. #OrbBecomesYou

4/ step three: toss orb one into the void. some say 'the higher, the better' but I say 'the higher, the faster'. a single toss can elevate you from amateur "juggler" to an elite "orb captain." float above the haters, unburdened by gravity. #FirstContact

5/ step four: throw orb two in a tight arc as orb one reaches its zenith. a cacophony of soaring orbs shall soon confound and disorient spectators who will be quick to suspect witchcraft. #PerpetualOrbMotion

6/ step five: be not afraid of orb failure. the greats have faced countless defeats in their quest to keep the orbs afloat. should you falter, simply raise your face to the heavens, shovel a handful of dirt into your mouth, and restart the orb dance. #RiseAbove

7/ step six: bask in the glory of successful orbitude. A true juggling Promethean has been born. Let your profile soar like the orbs, as you taunt gravity and prove conclusively the adage: "Jugger make jugglee, and jugglee make world" #OrbLord

8/ by following this sacred path, your life force will intertwine with the juggler's journey. armed only with the orbs, join me in piercing the veil of mortal limits and dancing with the gods in the realm of eternal orb elevation, up there with the all-dril! #JuggleOn
