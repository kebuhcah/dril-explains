1/6 Just got my Ph.D. in POWER STEERING, so buckle up. Time to guide the imbecile masses on the forbidden knowledge of the steering wheel technology.

2/6 Picture this: big ass car slides hard with the grace of a muscly man on buttered kitchen floor. This car is rigged with THE MOST POWER. We're talking CONTROL like God in your hands.

3/6 So you may ask, what allows a car to harness this divinity? The answer -- TRANSFERING POWER from the engine to the steering, like a snake slithering through your wheel, or the wires in your brain.

4/6 There's two types of Power Steering, but I'll give you a history lesson for free: Hydraulic System aka "wet boy" and Electric System aka "robotic grip". You're welcome Twitter users. We're living in 2021.

5/6 Not all cars can handle this iconic technology though. Power steering has ruined more lives than it has saved. Keep a watchful eye, civilians. Prepare to hand steer like a medieval peasant.

6/6 In conclusion, power steering is like being gently choked by God but in a car. Namaste. #automotiveknowledge #powersteering #stayblessed
