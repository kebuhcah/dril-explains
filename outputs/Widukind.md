1/ time 2 embark on a saga of power..of mystery..of dark ancient forces...and of a name that strikes fear into the hearts of germans...the tale of Widukind the Saxon King...

2/ oh how foolish those ppl in 782 AD. thinking they can opress WiduKind, the ultimate king of Saxons, whose badass name basically means "ForestChild" (chekmate treelovers)

3/ so Widukind is like "u kno what this land needs? a BIG dose of Saxon kulture" while ol' Charlemagne's having his fancy Frankish raves, forcing everyone to learn French omelette recipes smh

4/ big bad WiduK takes a breather somewhere in the wild Danish jungles (thats right, insane times), strategizes & rallies his Saxon pals to show charlamagne a thing or two about true rebellion spirit 

5/ of course, our man W slaps around Charlemagne multiple times in fire-kissed battlefields, proving gristly widU-wisdom beats wannabe roman loser empire conquests

6/ To be fair, Widukind punches his way thru hellish wars, and after a while, no one to count the bodies #savage. but Charlamange's got a sick trick up his holy sleeve...the baptism card!

7/ yeah u heard that right. after years of flipping charly-boy the bird, widukind converts to christianity in A Nutshell. now saint lore says they met at Paderborn, for intense mono-e-mon-o baptnism duel

8/ so now WiduK the Saxon Legend and Charley-magne part their separate paths, one wearing a new cross, the other a croissant...a tale of betrayal? or salvation? who the fuck knows.

9/ but next time ur in ur basement, re-enacting those lil Dark age battles w/ action figures, just rememberâ€”never bet against the WiduK, for the spirit of the ForestChild lives strong in the dril-eneration
