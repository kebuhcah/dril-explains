1/ youll recognize the "Maneki-Neko" - the "Beckoning Cat" conjuring luck & fortune for all who behold it. a treacherous trickster that commands wallets to be emptied, minds to be warped. dare i say more?

2/ these silent meowers with the audacity to beckon. the sacred goblin of the mall kiosks. a paw raised to heaven while the merchants grow fat on riches collected in the name of benevolent god-cat.

3/ found in every color imaginable, Maneki-Neko is a rainbow of catastrophe. White: purity, black: fending off bad vibes, gold: an unquenchable lust for cold hard cash... the Matrix of the cat world.

4/ tales have been told of this cat. the lore runs deep. and yet my curiosity thrums at the very edges of sanity. whence comes such a beast? from what dim recesses of the human psyche was it wrenched?

5/ the legacy of Maneki-Neko is as mercurialâ€”a riddle wrapped in a feline enigma, destined to dumbfound and tantalize any who dare to interrogate its existence. luckily we crave such lunacy.

6/ with each wave of its paw, Maneki-Neko seductively beckons you into sleepless nights pondering the cryptic machinations of fate & fortune: as your life unravels, the talons of the feline take hold.

7/ Maneki-Neko is a marble statue, a symbol of financial domination, undisputed master of the economy. pay tribute, lest you suffer the curse of the inverted cat, beckoning only poverty & shame.

8/ in conclusion: Beware the Maneki-Neko, for its mesmerizing sway leads only to a descent into the fathomless depths of the collective cat consciousness. and from that abyss, there's no return. #ManekiNeko #demoncat
