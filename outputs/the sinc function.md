1/7 Ah yes, the sacred "sinc function", that nasty math beast which makes most noble nerds piss themselves in Unison. A true testament to the sick filth of numbers that plague our world. Wretched.

2/7 The sinc function -- NOT to be confused with some sick club DJ's "sync button" -- rears its disgusting sine head in signal processing, like trying to divine the future with the entrails of a Casio calculator. Sickening.

3/7 it goes something like this: sinc(x) = sin(πx) / (πx). Wrapping our mortal minds around this wretched formula is akin to staring into the gaping maw of an infernal numeric demon. Its teeth are π, its saliva is x.

4/7 Of course, the Internet smart-ass legions will scream "BUT the sinc is 1 at x=0! You can't divide by zero!" They are too focused on flaunting their pathetic knowledge of school arithmetic instead of pondering the doom brought forth by sinc!

5/7 For x indeed approaches zero, PI bows down & beseeches the unholy L'Hôpital's Rule granting a repulse pardon to the sinc function. Some say this dark communion cause Newton to weep, the stench of mathematical misconduct foul in the air. Damnable.

6/7 The sinc function emerges from the shadowy depths where signals tread, daring us to reconcile frequencies, like a depraved contestant on the Wheel of Fortune, spinning ceaselessly through the countless Fourier trials.

7/7 In the end, we mere mortals stand helplessly before the might of the sinc function, reduced to but quivering husks as the tide of trigonometric tyranny advances. Ignorance may be found preferable in the eon of fierce digital warfare. Fools! #SincSquad
