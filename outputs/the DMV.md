1/12 - As I wait in the hallowed halls of the DMV, I ponder my existence as one must do when faced with the awe-inspiring bureaucracy that dictates our car and license fates - this is my Dungeon Master Vehicle.

2/12 - The DMV staff take their place as the archetypal Shit Lords of ancient manuscript, wielding the mighty power of Rubber Stamps and Ghostly Photos. Tremble before their form! Thy time has come.

3/12 - Accursed LINE, thou serpent winding ever onward, suffocating life and hope like a pissed off python. A true testament to the ceaseless march of suffering that is modern society. #LicenseQuest2019

4/12 - The sweet, sweet sound of the bone-chilling digital beep caller announces my destiny. To jostle forth thru this restless throng of LINE WRETCHES, eagerly awaiting the chance to embrace my bureaucratic overlords.

5/12 - Eyes glazed, faces long, a sea of would-be drivers and renewals submerged in the purgatory of forms and waits. I observe a fellow DMV pilgrim scolding the clock, his mind twisted by boredom, a victim of TIME itself.

6/12 - Perhaps the DMV, like some other worldly beast, feasts upon our hours and sustenance. Fueled by the dreams that still linger in a weary driver's eye, it maintains its ironclad grip on the automotive landscape.

7/12 - The sacred texts of paperwork forge a fragile pact between us pitiful mortals and the DMV gods. Botch the ritual, and hearken not their call. Face the eternal DAMNATION and embarrassment of a #DeniedLicense.

8/12 - A great and terrible wailing marks the death of a laptop's battery. All who bear witness know it as the Banshee's screaming harbinger of terror - the curse of productivity hath measured its final keystroke.

9/12 - Hath my number been called? Nay, number 69 smirks from its official DMV-printed slip. A fellow traveler must have pilfered it. They stand in shame, their future unknown. #LicenseQuest2019 is not for the weak.

10/12 - I offer my tribute at the altar of DMV. Yon divine clerk is merciful, waving fingers over keys like a symphonic conductor. In her majestic presence, the digits that bind me finally bow in unison. I am FREE.

11/12 - The thunderous roar of the EXIT door beckons sweet freedom! I, a weary traveler wronged by the expanse of bureaucratic hell known as the DMV, emerge victorious, license clasped tight in my calloused hand. 

12/12 - And so ends the tale of the DMV, the great beast, tempered and placated, for now it lies dormant. It shan't rest forever, alas, and I must be ready for #LicenseQuest2021. Beware! Beware! And answer its summons.
