1/7: HELL YES my friends its about goddamn TIME I educate the masses about the ancient Egyptian Goddess-Queen Cleopatra . Buckle The Fuck In for a WILD RIDE.

2/7: Absolute irrefutable FACTS: Cleopatra was the last Pharaoh of Egypt. Dating a Roman Empire general was her kink & did you know they called her "Cleo" as an affectionate nickname?? Affection is a lie invented by the Romans, to sell hugs.

3/7: She could speak like 12 languages or some shit, but nobody knows how she learned em'. Some say she was taught by birds, others say she absorbed the souls of historians in ancient Sarcophagi. Classic Cleopatra Move #CCM

4/7: SOURCES confirm Cleo was big into partying hard on a barge named "The Pussy Boat". No seriously, barge parties were lit & imagine being a guest there. "thank you, your enslaving highness, for giving me a chance to rub elbows with mummies"

5/7: People today are hard for good parenting strategies. Well, history time loser.. Mother Cleopatra dumped her kids on a snake desert island with just a jar of sand to survive. Who among us would risk it all for the Ultimate Parenting Flex?

6/7: THE FACTS CONTINUE: Cleo was SNEKKO-phobic which is ironic because she's now best remembered for sticking a snake into her chest for the Venom Titty Aid. Who wouldn't stick a venomous snake into their chest for the sake of cool factor?

7/7: anyway thats the dirt on cleopatra.. next week we tackle genghis khan, who was actually a chill guy who liked to knit and sip tea surrounded by flower gardens. tweets from the fringe of recorded history by @dril, the one and only #HistoryByDril
