1/ Ah yes, the noble path of investigative journalism - delving deep into the crypts of truth, digging up the bones of lies, and showing the unwashed plebs the true face of the world. Grab your fedoras and notepads, imbeciles, for I shall unfold this arcane art before your eyes. #JournalismWisdom

2/ First, you must harness the primal desire to EXPOSE—demand answers from unwilling voices—shove your Dictaphone into the faces of the guilty, the innocent, the utterly clueless. None shall be spared from your interrogative wrath. Only then shall you weave a narrative web of intrigue. #TruthRage

3/ Take inspiration from our brethren of the digital realm—hackers who speak in codes and whispers—bathe in the raw neon glow of their online conquests. Steal their digital prowess or face their pixelated wrath. You must walk the line, for journalism has no time for law. #KeyboardVigilantes

4/ Immerse your mind in the labyrinth of deceit dregs that fester in the bowels of our society. Master the dialects of the Underweb. Become fluent in QAnon, 10Chan, 100Chan, gifting you vision beyond the veil—a grandmaster of the seedy underbelly. Caution! Remember to cleanse. #RiddleMaster

5/ Reporter fuel, my pupils: Guzzle a tumbler of 5-hour Energy & black coffee, let insomnia be thy bitch. Rummage the dumpsters of official buildings with your incriminating evidence Gloves of +5 sleuthing. No mountain of trash shall harbor secrets from your grasp. #JournalistJuice

6/ Amass allies—you need grifters, swindlers, underground sources. Consortium of the deranged & bespectacled. Build an network of compatriots whose loyalty you can trust. Get matching tattoos or blood oaths to ensure their allegiance, whatever gets the job done. #SecretSocietyGang

7/ A wardrobe fit for a hunter of truth is no frivolous matter—cloaks, disguise kits, a trench coat riddled with mystery. The clothes shall makeeth the investigative journalist. Appear and vanish into the crowds with ease, just as our chameleon-like quarry demands. #FashionFiends

8/ The final rite: concoct your manifesto, your magnum opus, the article that will free humanity from its self-inflicted shackles of corruption. Avenge the helpless! Slay the political beast! Invoke only the finest of narratives! Be the hero this world requires! #UltimateJournalistMoment

9/ Emerge from this mentally decaying thread, transformed. Armed with metaphysical weapons of mass deduction, you are now an investigative journalist of legend. Accept your new mantle & face the chaos of our realm with courage. For I, @dril, have bestowed this knowledge upon you. #GodSpeed
