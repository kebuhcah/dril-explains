1/ ah yes, the timeless art of CosPlay. donning the most extravagant and high-quality, hand-sewn outfits, only to be told "Ur an adult in a costume... stop being a Weird freak" #FreedomOfExpression

2/ cosplay: the ultimate act of devotion. becoming the character you love so that you may finally be at one with their essence. suddenly, Twitter. someone replies "You will never BE Goku, idiot." crushing my dreams.

3/ mastering the art of cosplay is no ordinary feat. it demands skill, passion, and bravery. entering the sewing machine arena like it's some sick gladiator battle. stitching my way to infinity.

4/ the perfect costume has been achieved. bathed in sweat, thread, and triumphâ€¦ I enter the hallowed halls of the convention only to be faced with the most dreaded fate: the parallel cosplayer. another freaking Pikachu.

5/ cosplay confrontation: desperate to claim my title as the best-dressed fan, we stage a sudden duel of costume prowess right on the convention floor. attendees look on, breathless, as we trade blows and lose dignity. the poison of rivalry.

6/ cosplay , it's like stepping on a live grenade of lookalikes, holding your breath to see if you lose your limbs or your pride. and yet, like a moth drawn to the flame, we keep coming back. when will we learn.
