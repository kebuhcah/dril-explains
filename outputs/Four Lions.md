1/ just watched this film calld "four lions" and lads, I am now an expert on jih#d studies. It's a documentary about eagles, right? Wrong!! It's about the hijinks of Briti'sh terror bros

2/ "four lions" teaches us that even sworn enemies of the state can be just as bad at managing their clownish antics as the rest of the boys. "terrorism" is not immune to fraternal blunders

3/ want 2 emphasize that this films not for the faint of heart - expect explosive moments & also sheep. ton of sheep. Did the sheep sign up for this? hell no. but they're still in it

4/ one lion is like the "brains" of the operation, obsessed with keeping the crew on track, becoms totally unhinged, may or may not has a fetish for bleach? Seems quite convinced on the bleach thing.

5/ other lion's living double life, got a radical wife cheering him on & bossy brother spitting the biggest venom on his jih#d dreams. Brotherly hate fueling global hate!

6/ "four lions" shows us that terror bros are just like gamer bros, same aggression, argument over who gets to die first in a video game, but in real life. Extreme Risk for extreme gamers!!

7/ favorite part of film is when the boys acquire a treasure trove of explosives, but absolutely cannot figure out how to properly use them. Might as well be trying to assemble IKEA furniture

8/ in conclusion, "four lions" is an eye-opening peek into the world of the goofiest jih#dis ever. Give it a watch if ur ready to feast ur peepin eyes on comedy as dark as my tweets. FOr Lions, For Missteps!
