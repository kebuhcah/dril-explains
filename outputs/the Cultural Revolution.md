1/ BREAKING: Just been informed of a "Cultural Revolution". Apparently it was a Big Deal. Trying to get to the bottom of this, but the phrase "destroying the four olds" has peaked my curiousity. Will update.

2/ The Cultural Revolution -chairman Mao erupts on scene with big wide eyes, saying "lets cause a lil chaos" and BAM! old thoughts CANCELED. thousands of teens doing hootinanny over dead landlord art & culture. no more statutes, no more treatises , it's all fair games baby!

3/ FOR THE RECORD: im pro cultural revolution. my Powerful Mind can not be contained by the pathetic shackles of history. mindfully preparing for the thunderous applause when four olds, once hooted in the dark corners, leave the town for good.

4/ just discovered the Red Gaurds: marauding bands of teens who definitely treat the Cultural Revolution like some sort of excuse to insult their dads. slight anti-dad bias detected, but must remain neutral for journalist integrity

5/ self-criticism sessions are now required? guess i'll start by telling my 47000 soldier of followers that I never read Sun Tzu's art of war, never bought it. but Im sick at tictactoe, And that's basically the same, so back off.

6/ It's all coming crystallizing clear now. the gist of this Cultural Revolution saga: destroying old ways, rebooting society from scratch, and pissing off absolutely everyone in its trajectory, including me. Dril, once a humble internet historian, now a full-blown reactionary.

7/ bizarre twist. hearing rumors that Chairman Mao, orchestrator of the Great Leap Forward, is in fact now the chairman of Twitter? shit; that would explain all the mysterious banging & clanging outside my window. ive been targeted.

8/ Cultural Revolution, an epochal event or some twisted fan fare of fanatic ideology? No matter where you stand remember I, Dril, have endured it all. As the dust settles, still clutching to the remaining shreds of tattered four olds, ready to share the darkness to the world.
