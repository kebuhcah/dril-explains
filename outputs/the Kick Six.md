(tweet 1/6) once again privileged to tax my chud brain with the solemn task of elucidating the mysterious phenomena known only as the "Kick Six." gather round, sweet followers

(tweet 2/6) the year was 2013, the month of November. In the sky, an omen foretold; on the ground, two ferocious teams of wrathful men clad in thick armor, Auburn and Alabama, stood poised to destroy one another. #IronBowl

(tweet 3/6) at this juncture, I must HEAVILY stress the concept of "kicking". in the ancient realm of "FootBowl," the art of kicking with one's leg extremity reigns supreme. points are gained and the defeated cast into oblivion. kick or die

(tweet 4/6) as the clock waned, fortune turned on a bottle cap. all was tied, an opportunity for Alabama to claim victory, they requested to kick. to put foot to orb, to spiral into the starless night. destiny hung in the air, or so they thought

(tweet 5/6) but behold! the defenders of Auburn held firm. although the kick sliced through the night, it fell short, and into the ready arms of an agile warrior. nay, the gods would not smile upon Alabama's cavalier gambit. #KickSix

(tweet 6/6) Auburn's champion endures, sprinting 109 yards, like a hounded gazelle evading the clutches of Hades. as the field quivers under his hellish pace, the crowd roars its triumph, and the blaring trumpets of eternity herald the "Kick Six" into the annals of legend
