1/ just saw edge of tomorrow, the movie where tom cruise keeps hogging all the days. buddy its called sharing. ever heard of it?

2/ the maniacs in edge of tomorrow keep letting tom relive the day like a twisted groundhog. stop it. let him sleep. deprarartion of human rights!!!

3/ so theres this blue goop in edge of tomorrow that lets you loop a day until you die enough. somebody send me like 2 gallons of that. ill be unstoppable at the local buffet.

4/ edge of tomorrow has these "alpha" aliens. big time badasses. they probly drive around in giant T-Rex shaped hummers crushing skulls.

5/ tom cruise finds his soul mate in edge of tomorrow by dying a zillion times. meanwhile im dying inside every day and got zero soul mates from it. thanks hollywood.

6/ edge of tomorrow = a movie about doing the same thing over and over but still getting weird and fun each time. i guess what im saying is who wants to replay poker tonight

7/ edge of tomorrow should've been called "die, loop, roll around in goo, repeat" because that's basically my sunday night routine.

8/ in conclusion, edge of tomorrow teaches us that if you die enough times you eventually get good at killing aliens or whatever. wise words for a world that doesnt suck ass. #edgeofdrilorrow
