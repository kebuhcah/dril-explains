1/ just got my hands on an exclusive insider look at the new hit sensation sweeping the planet: "Paranormal Activity"!! buckle up folks, things are about to get spooky as shit. #GhostReal

2/ now, i'm not sayin i believe in ghosts, but i seen enough ghosts busted to know they're not all just big gas leaks or guys in masks. so when i heard about this Paranormal biz, i got more fired up than a microwave at a weenie roast. #TooHotToHandle

3/ ok, so the movie starts with this couple gettin haunted by something they absolutely cannot prove. coincedence? i think not. they should put a sign on the door - "GHOSTS BEWARE!! you're under survelliance!!" #PoltergeistJunction

4/ and let me be perfectly clear. i did not stash all of those blank VHS tapes in my garage for nothing. when ghosts start slipping into my house like an unwanted flan into a lady's boudoir, I WILL be prepared. #VHSPrepper

5/ but back to the ghostly goings-on! the couple starts actin weirder than a damn dachshund with a saxophone. doors flyin open, pans bangin... some freak goulash of invisible phantoms up in their business. Ain't no sleepin with that shit goin' down! #BedShakerExtraordinaire

6/ the plot thickens, like really thick - thicker than the bowl of chili i've been eatin since last thursday. a psychic gets involved, letting us know it's bigtime, and the war between man and demonic presence becomes a battle of wits. #MentalGymnastics

7/ i'll be damned if i let a ghost outsmart me, though. my brain is so twisted up from years of absurdity, the paranormal couldn't possibly comprehend my defenses. #CantHauntWhatYouCantUnderstand

8/ now, i won't spoil the end for any of you rubes who ain't seen the movie yet. but let's just say, this spooktacular jamboree of haunted hi-jinks has taught me one thing: never ever joke about ghosts, or they'll haunt your ass for real. #GhotsDontCottonToJests

9/ in conclusion, my rating for "Paranormal Activity" is 5 out of 5 oily rags. cuz if there's one thing i know about oily rags, it's that they burn real bright - just like this new cinematic classic. #GhostBusterCertified
