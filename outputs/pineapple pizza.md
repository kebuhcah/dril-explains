1/7 just had my first bite of this so-called "Pineapple Pizza" and i must say it tastes like a forbidden fruit marinated in warfare. Will continue to investigate further.

2/7 make no mistake... the culinary fusion of pineapple and pizza is as divisive as the classic anime = "cartoons" debate . But I will forge on, undeterred

3/7 so far ive discovered that the sweetness of the pineapple intricately blends with the saltiness of cheese and ham. or perhaps its an elaborate scheme to weaken the meaning of pizza itself.

4/7 Pineapple pizza feels like a fever dream where the sun and the moon collide in a frenzy and explode onto a pie for the confused masochists, who can't decide if they cherish what they eat or despise it.

5/7 I am now standing in solidarity with those who opine that pizza is a canvas, limitless in its potential as a playground for one to annihilate their tastebuds with unimaginable combinations.

6/7 those who deny the existence of the pineapple pizza, u are nothing but graceless cowards. U dare contest the union of an ancient fruit and pizza dough? Face the wrath of the pizza cabal

7/7 As the memelord of the cyberzone, I have come to an undeniable collusion: pineapple pizza's existence is as r√©al as the war between piss and shit. We must embrace it, despite its hallowed existence. good night.
