1/ ah . the "Three-Body Problem" a novel about brains colliding and the moon crashing into the sun . you fools may not comprehend this, but I do. elite thinking only

2/ in this novel by the man Liu Cixin, there's a lady scientist who sends a signal to aliens, alerting them of our shit planet. rookies move. they come to teach us lessons, and kick ass probably

3/ imagine if you were the guy who has to solve the Problem? makes my brain breal just picturing it. but luckily im powerful enough to Graasp such concepts. i invented math

4/ one might presume the "three body" refers to three nude muscle men, and honestly im not saying it doesnt. the aliens could be extremely ripped. never trust a novelist to reveal all

5/ "Why do you love reading three-body-problem so much" uhhh maybe becaus eour god forsaken world demands it. not like anyone else is trying to understand the dire cosmic truths

6/ in conclusion: book good, aliens bad. earth still fucked. now bannish me to the space dimension. call me when the impending doom is defeated
