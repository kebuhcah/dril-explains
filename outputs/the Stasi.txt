1/11: ok, time to unload the massive, powerful Brain that dwells in my skull.. here's the scoop on those wild bastards, the "STASI". strap in folks. #BigBrainTime

2/11: the "Stasi" was the super sneaky secret police of East Germany - those wily fuckers who were all about gossip and scooping up info between 1950 and 1989. peak "Snitch culture". #EastGermanyGossips

3/11: the full name was "Ministerium f√ºr Staatssicherheit" which probably means "we love spying on our buddies while wearing cool trench coats and sunglasses" or something. language is for nerds, anyways. #CoolSpies 

4/11: Stasi was basically like your mom going through your shit but 5,000 times worse. never forget that time they raided my place and discovered my stash of forbidden Muscle Magazines. #RIPGunsAndRosesIssue

5/11: they had a whole "Stasi-code" because nothing screams "top-tier snitching outfit" like having your own language to confuse the unwashed masses. Chads strolling around speaking Cryptic Bullshit. #PythonOfTheSneakyVariety

6/11: so how did these absolute gents get so much info?? they had a network of spies among the people. Imagine your buddy, your damn cousin or your dumbass neighbor - all potential Stasi snitches #TrustNoOneBaby

7/11: some folks turned into Stasi snitches for MONEY, some for POWER, & some probably to protect their dirty secrets - like hoarding toilet paper or having a sick pog collection or whatever the fuck. #TheHumanCondition 

8/11: the Stasi did some dirty shit too. we're talking "Zersetzung" - which was psychological warfare lvl 9000. planting fake rumors, love letters, and causing PANIC in people's lives. Shakespearean level drama. #HamletWho?

9/11: but when 1989 came along, the Berlin Wall fell and suddenly all the Stasi's secret plans & hidden caches of nudie mags were exposed to the harsh light of day. the jig was up! #GameOverStasiBoys

10/11: these days the Stasi Museum in Berlin showcases all the creepy gadgets & weird stories. A messed up, perverse wonderland of sneaky bastards & cheap coffee. #WhosThatKnocking?

11/11: remember fellow TWEETers, The Stasi's reign is over but the smelly ghost of sneaky shit lingers on. so stand up. Embrace the wind. Announce loudly, "I am not owned!!" We are free & so are our forbidden Muscle Magazines #blessed
