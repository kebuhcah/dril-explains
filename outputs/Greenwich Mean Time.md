1/ Absolute fools clamoring to announce the clocks function. Dare they consider the feral, unbreakable force of nature that is - Greenwich Mean Time? COWER before it's endless march, every second a reminder of our fragile lives #GMT #TimeConqueror

2/ Sitting with my dogs at the Prime Meridian, asking them if they are brave enough to comprehend the meridian basis of world time. They stare back, silent guardians of the divine standard. #DogsofTime

3/ "Time is an illusion, lunchtime doubly so." A wise hero once said, as they sipped from the golden chalice of knowledge, filled with the sweet nectar of illusions. The old man, mercilessly chained to the ticking clocks, can ONLY IMAGINE the ecstasy of escaping GMT #TimeEnlightenment

4/ Shifting my entire life by 15 degree increments based on longitude to wage WAR against the tyranny of time zones. Cowards continue their pathetic routines, unaware of the cosmic joke played on them by those who dare to wield the power of Greenwich Mean Time.

5/ Can anyone truly master the enigma of Universal Time Coordinated? Such is the question I ponder on this endless quest of epochs. As UTC travels in linear paths, it dares to meld into the twisted beast that we know as Time Zones. Fear! For it may beat us yet! #TimeZonePuzzle

6/ In conclusion, if one were to define absolute dominion over this temporal hellscape that is life, it would be summarized in the grasp of the IDOL of Greenwich Mean Time. Cherish each tick, lest we remain captive by the clock's relentless pendulum. #GMT_Domination
