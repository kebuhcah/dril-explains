1/6 alright shit heads, time to learn the "Punic Wars", the thrilling saga of ancient Rome and Carthage going off the rails, trying to find out who can piss off who the most #PunicWars #ClassicContent

2/6 First off, the big swinging dick of the Mediterranean, Hannibal Barca. He's on some mountain crushing 4Loko cans on his head and taking an elephant ride into Italy. The absolute mad genius of crossing the Alps? Unprecedented #Hannibal #RideOrDie

3/6 Rome is pissed. Their toga parties interrupted by some elephant man - "Carthage must be destroyed!" they scream while slamming olives & wine. Each war (like any good trilogy) has escalating stakes & twists. Fuckers galore! #ScipioAfricanus #SwornEnemies

4/6 Yo, these wars aren't just about mammoth beasts & handsome warlords. We're talking scorched earth policies, starving populations, naval battles with ships swapping crews in hand-to-hand combat! Total madness! #SaltTheEarth #MaritimeFistFight

5/6 Spoiler alert - Rome CRUSHES Carthage. They don't just beat them, they go full Sith Lord, killing everyone & salting the Earth. All because Hannibal couldn't take a hint and stay out of Italy. He was Rome's worst nightmare. #GameOver #PyrrhicVictory

6/6 And that's the long, strange, and bastard ridden tale of the Punic Wars, my fellow hopeless sycophants. Remember, if you ever find yourself riding an elephant down from a mountain to prove a point, you're either a genius or a psychopath. #PunicWars #MementoMori
