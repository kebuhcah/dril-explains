1/ Just found out about 21 Jump Street, an entire police force dedicated to making grown men look like teenagers to infiltrate high schools. This might be the most perplexing system of law enforcement I have ever witnessed. #WhyNot22JumpStreet

2/ I've been told this "21 Jump Street" has spawned a movie series, as if making one film was not an adequate amount of content to express the utter amazement of geriatric dudes pretending to be paranoid about getting acne. #RoleReversal

3/ These so-called undercover teenage cops crack the hardest cases - like solving the mystery of state-mandated standardized tests while chugging gallons of cheap beer at an after-school rager. godspeed, my noble public servants. #BackToHighSchoolAgain

4/ Learning that Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum & Ice Cube were duped into submitting their mortal souls to this timeless, high school-based purgatory. Dear sirs, I offer my condolences and a heartfelt F in the chat. #ForeverYoung #HollywoodHell

5/ I now must ponder on the implications of the movie's sequel, "22 Jump Street." Perhaps they discovered an adjacent street with further secrets which will expand my tattered brain beyond the borders of humanity. #UnravelingTheJumpStreetMysteries

6/ In conclusion, I can now look forward to a lifetime of being haunted by visions of cops posing as teens in increasingly absurd situations, knowing that these undeniable forces of chaos are no longer constrained to a single street. #CantStopTheJumpStreetTrain
