THREAD: 1/5

ALRIGHT FOLKS. Ive been given NO choice but to solve the Mystery that plaques this hellish medium-Twitter.com. Thats right. They Call it "GIF". Settle in, you Filthy Animals, Cause we're in for a night of Debates and Misery.

First We Must consult the Wizards. People always Talk about "CHOOSY MOMS CHOOSE JIF". as if Peanut Butter has any Stakes In this Goddamned Situation. I like peanuts!! but their poisonous Toxins have No power over the sanctity Of This Dread Image Format.

But now, every Scholar and buffoon will screech “It’s JIFF”: (J)raphics Interchange Format!! As if I give Two Shits about cute Acronyms or that sneaky letter "J" - The chameleon of The alphabet. My Bonehead enemies forget that Professor GIF Himself said it's Gif With A G.

I am NOT AFRAID to go against the Word of a creator. If my son tells me to pronounce his name "Hickory Smoke" am I bound by law? Am I a prisoner in my own home. Absolutely not. I am a sovereign citizen of the world.

In Conclusion, GIF is beyond comprehension of mortal tongues. It transcends all logic and grammar, casting Us all into a breakroom argument with No end. Rise above & free yourself from chains of "Gif" "Jif" "Gyf" and enjoy this digital hellscape. #ImWithTheMemes
