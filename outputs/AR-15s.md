1/ just had a revelation. the AR-15.. a gun so f***ed up it's like holding the screaming iron soul of america in your hands. god help us

2/ some say AR-15 stands for "Assault Rifle", others "Arm-alite Rifle"...i prefer the name i gave it: "Apocalyptic Rage-Rod". seems fitting

3/ they say bullets from ar-15s go so fast they are invisible to the naked eye. my eyes are fully clothed and i still can't see them. explain that

4/ "ar 15's are a tool for self-defense," i say as i accidentally shoot 500 rounds/minute through my ceiling, terrorizing the neighborhood

5/ a mysterious stranger handed me an ar-15 and whispered, "Use this to defend liberty." i accidentally pressed the trigger, becoming the first man to successfully shoot the concept of freedom

6/ everyone else on my street has an ar-15. it's the 2021 equivalent of borrowing a cup of sugar. i return their "sugar" by making it rain bullets in their yards

7/ sleep with an ar-15 under my pillow, wake up with profound understanding of the 2nd amendment. also, pillow is shredded and ears ringing.

8/ imagine if thomas jefferson had an ar-15. nothing would change because he'd probably still prefer a quill pen. paper beats rock, guns or not.

9/ in the wise words of wolverine: "i'm the best at what i do, and what i do is accidentally discharge my ar-15 while trying to show off"

10/ sliding down a mountain of .223 casings like an avalanche, securely fastened in my tactical diaper. the ar-15 lifestyle is as intoxicating as it is perplexing. god bless.
