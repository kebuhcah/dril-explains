1/ ah yes, the majestic SMART goals.. the very pillars of productivity, forged in the cauldrons of efficient Silicon Valley business incubators, and brought upon us mere mortals to bask in its profound glory...

2/ S: Specific... as in, "i specifically need my Diapers loaded with potassium supplements by 10am" - this is important. I demand precision in my diaper needs so Help me God.

3/ M: Measurable.. the art of quantifying your aspirations. like counting how many hot dogs one can stuff into one's mouth at once.. never falling short,, for I am the harbinger of hot dog greatness

4/ A: Achievable.. Ensure you don't take on tasks like "becoming the moon". It's best to stick to "becoming the neighborhood sheriff of crab control", a vital public service.''

5/ R: Relevant.. Like when I devote myself into being the official gas station bathroom inspector in my quest to safeguard Cleanliness, Hygiene & the Epic Toilet Scourge of our Existence.

6/ T: Time-bound.. make sure your goals have a deadline, or you'll end up chasing after them like a game of eternal bat & ball. only the ball is your tedious taxes, and the bat is an ornate high-impact coffee maker.

7/ In conclusion, SMART goals are both friend & foe, a complex matrix of office buzzwords, making us dance to their drum beats. heed their call, and ascend from mere Twitter User to Diaper-Potassium Gatekeeper of Industry. @dril has Spoken. #LifeLessons #PotassiumOverlods
