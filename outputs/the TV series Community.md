1/9 once again they insist i am the only one apt to explain the tv cinema puzzle known as "CommUnity" - a series which celebrates the hallowed halls of academic struggle and triumph alike by filling em with absolute buffoons.

2/9 each episode stumble upon a group of academically damned misfits, like fallen angels sent to propagate ludacris agendas inside greendale, the so called "typical" community college built on dangerously faulty principles.

3/9 the dean, somehow more bizarre than all clowns combined, is our conquistador bringing us ever deep into the murky realms of learning. embraced by his treasured icon, the human being mascot, groce unholly union unfolds before our very eyes.

4/9 and thus the master "jeff winger" assembles his uncanny reserve league within the study chamber to battle the forces of academic mediocrity; be it former spanish teachers turned drug lords or daunting world of subway sandwich arts.

5/9 encountering the timelines like a bastard assassin of reality! the band of halfwits dive deep into the abyss of curiosity, the paintballs war, pillow kingdoms, and chicken tenders crime. only to emerge gleaming and forever transformed. or not.

6/9 troy and abed in the morning, an excellent teleVisual radio program conveyed from darkest depths of this sitcom netherworlds, deliver contents from the bowels of a grotesque underseascape that can not but stimulate the souls of men and devils 

7/9 the mantra remains -six_seasons_and_a_movie- underpinning their belief in the sheer unbridled dominance of television serials, where the lords of content demand continuous appeasement, the sacred movie building upon their monument.

8/9 alas, sheer radiance of community tend to confound the weak & timid. its mighty voice resonates w/ the immortal gods, whispering insights behind normie eyes. parting clouds of foolery & adversity, we are graced by the chronicles of wisdom.

9/9 and thus i say unto you, humble followers, bear witness to this sacrilegious extravaganza called "Community" - a divine comedy, a clump of visions so pure, it leaves us scar'd if we dared to ponder the potential of a universe without it. #sixseasonsandamovie
