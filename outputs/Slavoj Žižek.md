1/ Ah, yes, the infamous Sloppy Joe "Zizzik" - a philosopher, a psychoanalyst, a cultural critic, and a man who god saw fit to make him sound like gurgling some pure coke in a blizzard.

2/ Žižek - a man who is to philosophy what I am to lubricating my entire body with dollar store Spaghetti-O's for performance art. Both mysterious and endlessly perplexing, we thrive as masters of our respective domains.

3/ What is ideology? What is the place of the Ego within society's shitstorm? Dont ask me, ask ol' Slovvy boy. or don't, you probably won't get a straight answer. That's the Žižek guarantee, baby!! *injects philosophy directly into veins* 

4/ Zizek's main jam is blending marxism and psychoanalysis like some unhinged cerebral bartender at a subterranean night club called "The Quagmire of Hegemony." Oh yeah, bottoms up!!

5/ Hear me out - Žižek and I tag team lecturing at those TED conferences, but instead of learning about the "perverted dance of the commodity," the audience is forced to watch us shotgun cans of Monster Energy, proclaiming "This is the Real!"

6/ "Hey everyone, I just read Zizek! Now im doing reverse marxist psychoanalysis on a sandwich to find out if its full of ideology or just fucked up salami." Typical Zizek Fan. Little do they know I have a Ph.D. in sandwich discourse deconstruction.

7/ In conclusion, Slavoj Žižek is like a philosophical jack-in-the-box: you crank that lever of dense theory over and over, only to be greeted with an explosion of incomprehensible delight. A true beacon of intellectual chaos in this mundane world.
