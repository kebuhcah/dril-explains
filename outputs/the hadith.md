1/7 - trying to domesticate a thousands year old oral tradition called "hadith" to solve shitposts quandary, suddenly finding myself knee deep in sunni & shiite; didnt sign up for this. anyway, here's what i learned

2/7 - hadith are basically side quests that unlock extra poignancy for religion- players aka Muslims like in MMOs of morality. you got the quran, but then hadith are like footnotes, kept down in pubs called mosques.

3/7 - the prophet muhammad drops hot takes just like any other guy, except when he does it, scholars collect that shit like baseball cards. sunni and shiite have diff sets of cards, dont trade them unless u want absolute bedlam

4/7 - heard these hadiths were graded and im all like "aight puttin 'sahih' hadiths in my bio to show the ladies i got a high level in hadith studies" but then my inbox gets blown up with folks arguing over the authenticity like its some sort of masters thesis

5/7 - beware of "weak" hadiths. not because they have less holy energy or are less potent in worship, but because they might be double agents set up to cause chaos, like gamer cartridges filled with explosives

6/7 - turns out, there's a whole crew of dudes called "muhaddith", devoting their lives to collecting these hadith beyblade discs; they spin em like tops, accumulate knowledge by the mouthful, and then distribute that wisdom to the masses in code named "chains of transmitters"

7/7 - in conclusion: the hadith market is extremely volatile. trust no hadith unless it bears the official dril Sahih®️-retweet stamp of approval. this is true religious literacy, folks - buckle up for some sweet virality
