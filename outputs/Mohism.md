1/ ah, yes.. the ancient chinese school of "Mohism". invented by some guy named mozi (no relation to the web browser). i have returned to once again enlighten the masses with my vast knowledge of morally correct frugality. buckle up, chumps.

2/ now, let me tell you about mohism's core belief - "Universal Love". sounds like some hippy-dippy crap, right? wrong! it's about loving everybody, Even the morons trying to sell me fake samsungs outside my apartment complex.

3/ like most cool things, mohism is all about striking down the tyrants. they were absolutely Against any sort of extravagant spending, ostentation, or wasteful bullshit. no fancy robes, no lime green lamborghinis, none of it. just the Essentials: wife, beans, wifi.

4/ mohists were also practical dudes, inventing sweet engineering techniques & military tech for defending cities from attackers. their approach to life was roughly: "if the gizmos don't protect the people, they ain't worth a damn". scientists, take note.

5/ let's not forget "meritocracy". can't have a bunch of incompetent assholes in charge, always screwing things up. no sir. mohism said pick the guy who knows what he's doing, not the guy who's your creepy cousin.

6/ but mohism fell out of favor 'cause confucius & his followers got beef with them. "can't have everyone loving everyone! not practical!" they said. well guess what, confucius my man, maybe you should've tried making more friends on warcraft instead.

7/ in conclusion, mohism was ahead of its time: kick-ass defenses, practical thinking, & caring for everyone. so next time you're in a yugioh tournament & someone tells you about their mohist great-great-great-grandfather, just remember - they mean business. the end. (7/7)
