1/7 im taking a deep dive into the shit abyss with my friend Thomas Stearns Eliot,, whomst wrote a big ass poem called "The Waste Land". the whole thing's a cursed cryptogram. skulls & crossbones

2/7 "April is the cruellest month" Mr. Eliot what ever happened to December when i get forced to wear a sweater for a family portrait. Absolutely vile. fucking get with the times.fltcldile

3/7 Prufrock may have measured out his life in coffee spoons but i measure mine in Mtn Dew cans piled up next to gaming computer - Poetry owns

4/7 pounds my keyboard in blind rage to simulate the "mixing of memory and desire" that t.s. eliot speaks of

5/7 the 'waste land' is exactly like video games. it has its own desert landscape and water hydrates the gamers, I mean readers

6/7 do not believe any body who claims to understand the waste land 100%. theyre full of shit n lying to your face. there is no solution only more chaos #poems_that_kill

7/7 The Waste Land is just the long version of a dril tweet - anti-war, anti-valadation, anti-bread, anti-gains. Godspeed in hell, thou long-dead poet. #HydrateTheWasteLand
