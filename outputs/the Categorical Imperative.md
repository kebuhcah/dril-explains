1/ Ah yes. the "Categorical Imperative" - when the wise philosoraptor Kant shits out a golden rule so hard that it becomes moral axle grease for society's wheels. But what the fuck is it exactly? Let's delve into this demented wisdom, my dipshit friends. #CategoricalImperative

2/ "The Real Deal Kant," a sick nickname I just made for him, painted an ethical picture with the cat imp (short for Categorical Imperative). He's like: "Treat yo self, but only if it's cool for EVERYONE to act that way!" That's some first-rate morality hustle right there. #KantIsMyHommie

3/ So picture this, Kant's chilling in his philosopher's cave, rubbing his moral loins, & he drops this on us: "act only according to maxims by which you can at the same time will that they become universal law." Holy shit, it's almost like he's saying, "no more being an asshole ever." #KantRaiseTheRoof

4/ But did Kant unleash this philosophy monster just for shits & giggles? Hell no! He's tackling the REAL issues - like, "should I rip off my neighbor's cheetos?" According to the cat imp, the answer is a big NO. If everyone stole cheetos, there'd be no damn cheetos left! #SaveTheCheetos

5/ with the "Categorical Imperative" in mind, you might think Kant is the ultimate buzz kill, sending ethical nut kicks whenever you want some harmless fun. But guess what? Our boy Kant just wants people to quit being selfish fucklords & to consider the bigger picture. #KantStopWontStop

6/ So next time you catch yourself questioning an action, just Uncage the Kant (tm) and ask yourself: "Do I want EVERYONE doing this?" If you're not cool with that, put your moral pants back on and walk away. Kant has your back. #UncageTheKant

7/ #PhilosopherMicDrop the Categorical Imperative: A simple, Kantastic guide to not being a human shit stain in society. Use it with wisdom, and for God's sake, never forget- the power to be a smelly piss goblin lies within us all. Let's be better, my beloved friends. #FromKantToCant
