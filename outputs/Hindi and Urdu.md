1/ just learned about the absolute chaos languages called "Hindi" and "Urdu".. various symbols, immense culture.. must be some sort of coding scam to keep nasa away from aliens

2/ tried watching a #Bollywood movie to gain insights into Hindi & Urdu linguistics - instead gained a wealth of knowledge about synchronized dancing & heartbreak, an education no mere school can provide

3/ hindi & urdu are both written in mysterious scripts called 'Devanagari' and 'Nasta'liq' - undoubtedly a tool used by ancient wizards to summon unstoppable cultural forces

4/ can't grasp the bizarre realms of grammar mechanics in these languages. How the hell am i supposed to remember gender for Everyday objects? Trash cans are female and jokers are male?! what absolute lunacy!

5/ burning the midnight ointment trying to learn those mad "tenses". the future, present, and past - whats next? Fourth dimension tenses, where verbs will disintegrate your clothes?

6/ heard that native speakers can communicate using both Hindi & Urdu despite their differences- some sort of secret code.. cannot help but respect such a formidable skill

7/ tried speaking a simple Hindi sentence at the local drug store, many people applauded my flawless pronunciation . Unsolicitedly, i am now the ambassador for good will and increased salary potential. signing off as a #LanguageMaster
