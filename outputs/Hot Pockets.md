1/ Ah,, yes. the so-called "hot pocket". a simple yet elegant relic designed single-handedly to fuel the American Dream. both vile and divine in its composition - not unlike the chaotic balance which holds this world together

2/ It seems the world begs mi not to " touch " the "Hot-Pocket" , but here i stand, amidst the deafening roar of hunger, demanding god himself to show me a more perfect meal, if he hath the balls

3/ The masterpiece of American cuisine, enrobed in its pock√©t of scorching inferno. Light one up, savor the burnin hellness of the pocket. A juxtaposition of comfort and certain doom. we eat, we cry, we thrive

4/ Each member of the 'hot pocket tribe' dances on the razor's edge, tempting disaster with every petty slander: "meat piss", "liquid ham". they cast their stones, yet time and time again they return; feasting on the altar of hot pocketry

5/ "CaUtIoN : FiLlInG iS hOt" they cry; as with fire, we know not to touch it.Wit upon these hot pockets, embrace the paradox- for in this liquid ham slurry we may find tender bliss, redefining disappointment with each successive bite

6/ In summation. should hot pockets be a crime to be banished from man's cupboard ? Certainly, but where were you when your cup run dry of wisdom, & you sought the victuals of an unhinged disgrace ? The beasts, they fill our voids. So it has been written.
