1/7 just discovered Haile Selassie, the last ethiopian emperor–apparently this guy ruled a whole country while having a name that sounds like a delicious yet fancy dessert. im lovin it

2/7 oh so he reigned from 1930-1974. impresive shit, managing a country that long. & he was also referred to as "King of Kings"?? damn, did they have a royal wrestling federation or something??

3/7 alright folks, diving deeper into Selassie-mania, learned he played a role in converting Ethiopia from feudalism to... wait for it... the "modern era"?? like a superhero turning a country into a smartphone? is that even real??

4/7 getting frustrated with the intricacies of history's nuances, but nevertheless ready to unveil my custom made Haile Selassie commemorative shirt which reads "I Stand With The Emperor of Ethiopia" followed by a picture of Rey Mysterio. confused but committed

5/7 big news coming out of the Selassie camp today: he's also considered a messiah in the Rastafari movement... they believe him to be the reincarnation of jesus?! i guess his title "King of Kings" makes sense now, but still can't stop thinking about wrestling royalty

6/7 after researching extensively & becoming more confused by the minute, I have decided to style my life in the honorable way of Selassie: not making any sense, but conquering & thriving all the same. salute to the emperor, doing whatever the hell he did

7/7 in conclusion, Haile Selassie: maybe a dessert, maybe a wrestler, likely an emperor, possibly a messiah–the man, the myth, the legend. confident in saying today i have become a true historian & may god kiss me gently on this journey of knowledge #SelassieFacts
