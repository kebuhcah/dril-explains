1/ ah yes, the ol "MKUltra", the fabled government mind-zap program from the swinging 60s. lets just say I KNOW a thing or two about "psychic warfare," if you catch my drift. #BrainHackers #MindMelters

2/ picture this: a clandestine hellscape of science experiments, where the CIA lures unsuspecting Jazz musicians into their lair, doses them with LSD, and turns them into human radio towers. frequencies everywhere #MKUltra

3/ the point? to develop super soldiers, my man. theyre designing a cryptic world of puppet masters and puppets. i, of course, am immune to this because I've wrapped my head with tin foil since the ripe age of 12. #Legend

4/ despite the "official" #MKUltra program being "discontinued" in the 1970s, the rogue methods live on in our very own marketing campaigns & reality TV. the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills are trained MKUltra assassins. mark my words #RHOBH

5/ listen, i dont want to start any rumors, but ive experiencd my fair share of mysterious psychic communiques. like that time I spilled milk in the kitchen and heard a voice say "clean that up, idiot." spooky. must be #MKUltra.

6/ in conclusion, #MKUltra was the government's attempt at unlocking the true power of the human mind. whether or not theyve succeeded, we may never know. but one thing is for sure, i have mastered the art of the perfect tweet. god bless
