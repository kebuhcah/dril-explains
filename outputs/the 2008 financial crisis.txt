1/ alright pissants, gather around for a one-of-a-kind Lecture on the 2008 financial shitstorm. prepare to be Enlighten'd by my Huge Brain.

2/ first off, dont even talk to me unless you know what a collateralized Debt Obligation is. it's when you take all your bull shit loans and turn it into a sweet sweet statue that says "profit" on it.

3/ we got these Big Time mortgage "brokers". they're out there, slinging loans to any poor bastard who's dumb enough to put their John Hancock on that line. due dilligence? Nah, more like Due Disaster.

4/ banks and investors absolutely creaming their jeans over these so-called "subprime" mortgages, when in reality the "sub" should have stood for "Subhuman acts of financial depravity"

5/ then, here comes the shitstorm. Market is fucked, people can't pay, and the damn bubble pops as if the Lord above just dropped his Abundance Needle on it. Now we've got houses up for grabs like an episode of Oprah. You get a foreclosure! And you get a foreclosure!

6/ the economy? Diaper filling. empty bowls of soup lined the streets, bankers clinging to their cash like a life raft made of dead grandmothers' hair.

7/ Fed scrambling to pick up the pieces, like an elephant in a china shop covered in glue, trying to glue the pieces back together. bailouts a plenty. I myself actually recieved $52,000 in bailout money which I spent on personalized bowling balls.

8/ Summary: the 2008 crisis was a monumental display of Capitalist Goblins having a blood orgy in a cauldron full of hot dog water. World will never be the same, but at least i got some sick ass bowling balls out of the deal. Life rolls on pals, life rolls on. #2008crisis #BigBrainTake
