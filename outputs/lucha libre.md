1/10 The noble art of Lucha Libre, an ancient form of wrestling perfected by noble foreign artists who understand that self respect means wearing a mask, flaunting acrobatics in front of thousands. #SkullMaskTime

2/10 In this realm of high flying combatants, one searches for truth by leaping off the top ropes, their masked visage a monument to honor, as they spin gracefully into the oblivion of staged agony. #TheMaskedAvengerIsMe

3/10 Lucha Libre stands superior to all other contact sports, as it requires the most essential tool: the mind. Only a true intellectual can execute a perfectly timed "hurricanrana" onto their opponents. #BrainiacSlam

4/10 Mythical personalities abound, each more mystifying than the last. El Santo, the Silver Masked Man, a legend whose body remains a vessel for the timeless spirit of nameless warriors. #SantoForever

5/10 But not all Luchadores are pure-hearted. There lies a dark underbelly within this glorious world - the rudos, whose only purpose is to fight dirty and rage war against honor & decency. #RudoGoHome

6/10 In this staged battleground of gods, thunderous forces clash in duels that shall be sung for generations, their masks taken as spoils of war when they fall. Their souls will shatter the heavens themselves. #EternalMaskQuest

7/10 As spectators we witness powers beyond human understanding - the unbeatable air dominance of "La Parka," the supernatural control of "Pentagon Jr.," the endless hunger of "Mil Mascaras." #LuchaElders

8/10 Not just a sport, a religion, a way of life - Lucha Libre is the very essence of the human spirit, where those who defy their inherent limits become immortalized in the cosmic pantheon of the ring. #MaskedInTheStars

9/10 And so I gaze upon this masked spectacle, partaking in rituals since time began, knowing that I, too, will one day leap & spin. My mask, my face, my soul will sync together in warrior's harmony. #SomedayMyMaskWillCome

10/10 For now, let us all pay heed to these titans of acrobatics, the Luchadores of legend. Let their tales be told and their spirits soar through the firmament; as surely as the sun rises, the masked gods will reign. #LuchaLibreForAll
