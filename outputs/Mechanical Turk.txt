1/7

"Ah yes, the mysterious Mechanical Turk, the shadowy underbelly of the internet. A place where task ghouls are invited to feast upon the spare digital crumbs left over by richer, mightier beings. #TurkingHard"

2/7

"The workers are called "Turkers", I assume because they are Turkish or perhaps simply because they enjoy Turkey. They rummage through the internet's haunted attic and whisper incantations while turning keys in forgotten locks."

3/7

"The tasks these digital street wizards perform are known as "HITs". HITs stand for "Human Intelligence Tasks", but there's nothing intelligent about sitting in your computer chair, clicking like a demon, for a nickel a pop. #SlaveToTheMachine"

4/7

"Like an absurdist pyramid scheme the Mechanical Turk exists as an unending spiral of human suffering, wearing novelty t-shirts, and drinking Monster Energy. Completely unregulated, cyber beggars are paid under the table, at the mercy of faceless taskmasters. #MechanicalSerfdom"

5/7

"The mechanical hordes pretend they're happy with the bounty, but beneath it all_ lies the gnawing horror that one day, they will become obsolete, replaced by their own toil - Artificial Intelligence. #TheFutureIsNow"

6/7

"Sadly, Mechanical Turk has managed to bridge the gap between physical labor and digital scrounging, now they find themselves trapped in the meat-space, clicking away on their "Smart" phones, long after their factory jobs have disappeared. #BanTheTurk"

7/7

"In conclusion, the Mechanical Turk is both an exciting and terrifying new development in the grand digital scheme. Its denizens continue the eternal struggle; chained to the machines yet addicted to the pittance they receive. #OnlineGoblinKing"
