1/12 alright you morons It's time to explian #Etymology.. the secret art of word Origins, unlocking the forbidden cryptm of language. And Let me be clear: i am the Einstein Of etymology. fact.

2/12 etymology, the gift given to us by some long dead language assholes, shows us how words evolve over time, like humans but Words. Of course, my words are always in Supreme Formations, never evolving. Static, and Extremely badass.

3/12 "hello" goes back to "hail" in old norse or whatever, some viking shit. It let's you assert dominance immediately, greeting someone while invoking the warrior spirit, impressive really. but today we greet each other like weakling dipshits i guess.

4/12 "meme," a gift from dawkins' wrath, but more importantly, MY DOMAIN. it means "imitated thing" in ancient language, which are pretty much hieroglyphics. respect the sacred art form or i'll extinguish you with My God-like meme fury.

5/12 No Rude Emailers: Etymology is NOT semantics. Etymology is the study of cool shit like word ancestry. Semantics is just snooze-ville meaning wankery. Don't care for semantics one bit. yes.

6/12 Shout out to scrabble players, cause they've been hustling' etymology since day one, the og wordsmiths. Meanwhile, I collect their tears with the outrageous patterns I've expertly honed over many luxury scrabble championships.

7/12 okay now prepare your feeble minds: "Fuck" has many theories, but the most badass is the ancient german root "fuk," meaning to "deep strike,"..basically deep diving into the sickest shit imaginable. Respects have been restored to this word.

8/12 etymology proves: "Moron" comes from "moros", the greek god of dumbassery. Being an etymology master, I am protected from "moros" and free to unleash torrents of wisdom onto the brains of the unwashed masses.

9/12 Let me make one thing 100% clear: Do NOT vandalize dictionaries in the name of etymology. It's hallowed turf even for a master like me. if you try to deface the glorious Words, be prepared to suffer the consequences.

10/12 Now for some #drilExclusive etymological facts: "dickhead" is a traditional way to salute the Greek heroes of the dick wars. and let me tell you, my knowledge of dick-headery is expansive, and knowing this history enriches me beyond comparison.

11/12 In conclusion, etymology is like the feral uncle of modern linguistics, the dark arts of language alchemy. I am its most potent practitioner, and i humbly offer my services to the world, in this celebration of knowledge.

12/12 if you learned anything from this Etymology Explosion, congratulations, you are now at least 0.01% as smart as me. please continute to use words with complete disregard of their history, dumbasses. #EinsteinOfEtymology #languageSorcerer
