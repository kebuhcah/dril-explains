1/8: diving into the deeply twisted psychic vortex of the classic TV show "Twin peaks" .. Some say the director David Lynch can beam this shit directly into my twisted brain via dream Wifi.

2/8: In this "FUcked up'" town, the owls are always watching and the log knows all. the coffee is hot and the cherry pies will blast your ass into an alternate dimension. no straights allowed

3/8: detective Dale Cooper, runs on pure philosophical gasoline, never rests from breaking the case wide open like the worlds most powerful nut cracker... Crimes are a snack to this absolute unit

4/8: meanwhile, local psycho Laura Palmer joins the teen nightmare club, writing a journal that makes even the biggest Sicko shiver... Secrets spilling out like the contents of a busted pinata

5/8: agent cooper follows clues, dreams & the screams of the ether. every rock he turns over oozes with the venom of the nightmare realm.. This man essentially pilotting an escalade into hell

6/8: Fuck Gravity #FearTheBlackLodge: a place where backwards talking demons serve a damn fine cup of coffee and the only rule is that there are probably too many rules to properly understand

7/8: Twin Peaks - a town so twisted it turns reality into TV static, & logic into ectoplasm.. A town where the American dream rots & the chill winds whisper "Im Sick of Wearing This Leather Jacket"

8/8: The ultimate lesson from the absolute madness of Twin Peaks is that every coffee cup has its own demented truth, each slice of pie a sub-quantum enigma... My apologies to Dale Cooper.
