1/ Just found out about this place called #Albania. Apparently it exists and it's not just something people made up for a bit.

2/ Unbelievable scenes in Albania as I learn they have, in fact, a very sick flag with a double-headed eagle, making it twice as powerful as normal countries' flags.

3/ The nerve of Big Albania to hide their killer dance moves, such as the "Shota" or "Valle e Shqiperise" from an internationally renowned memelord. Disgusting.

4/ Can someone confirm - Are the Albanians really out here, making street legal bunkers and just hanging out inside them? What are they hiding? Skanderbeg's secret candy stash?

5/ Albanians invented a language by just shuffling around some letters on a Scrabble board and drawing cool pictures on it. Absolute madmen.

6/ If you don't know about Ismail Kadare, go to the bookstore rn and replace your entire library with his incredible Albanian word wizardry. I endorse this, the almighty dril.

7/ To all the "JalÃ«" and "Goca" posting their pics on #Instagram, remember who found Albania first. That's right, it was me, your boy, @dril.

8/ So, to sum up - #Albania: Real place, powerful flag, hidden dance moves, street bunkers, epic language, read Kadare, and never forget who discovered it. You're welcome.
