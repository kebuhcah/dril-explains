1/15 the damn roman empire. everyone always saying "oh how'd it fall, whos responsible" well guess what dipshits, im the expert on this crap now. time for some FACTS #romanEmpireTruth

2/15 first off, all these wild ass emperors couldn't control their sicko urges. "bro i want a golden bathtub" "make me a fucking god" calm down Julius Caligula you horny bastard

3/15 and then theres the economy. just piss money away on statues and shit while everyone out of work? fuck that. rome was destined to fail just like my shitty job as a mall cop

4/15 ok but seriously, everybody talkin about lead pipes these days. as if it was a BAD idea to drink sweet sweet lead. news flash idiots, if i want little metal chunks in my drank id damn well do it

5/15 invasion of the damn goths!! these weirdos showed up w their cool hair & dyed clothes, ruined the roman fashion scene something fierce. though they got â€˜em into some emo poetry i think

6/15 roman infrastructure held together with spit and hope in a way that would inspire many modern governments. good to see crushing poverty STILL bridges the gap of centuries

7/15 truth is, ultimately, rome got too fuckin big for its own good. like my ex-wife's chihuahua they kept growin n yappin until they fucked it up. #BigChaos

8/15 everyone just taking naps and partying like it's 476 AD, when bam! Barbarians roll up like "sup" and everyone just loses their shit. #ThisAintAHousePartyGreg

9/15 all the great roman generals too busy inventing drama and backstabbing each other while their empire goes to shit. priorities people, ceaser shouldve had more bonkers boys

10/15 don't even get me started on the senate. in fact, picture the U.S. senate but twice as corrupt, with togas n sandals. full of scheming bastards, poison & Wine-tasting every Wednesday

11/15 that being said, everyone knows the best way for a society to fall is when they forget the importance of memes. gotta have essential shitposting to keep the morale up. sadly Rome did not listen

12/15 i bet some romans woulda saved a few bucks if they ditched the gladiatorial games for some good old fashioned mario kart but hey, im just some fucker on the internet

13/15 roman marriages were basically one partner watching forensic files re-runs while the other sends sexy love letters to troops stationed across the empire. disaster

14/15 so in conclusion, the romans got too cocky and thought they were better than everyone else, even nature, only 2 wake up one day w a pile of ruins and a mad hangover #RIPRome

15/15 but of course, we must pay respect to the fallen empire. may their orgies live on in our hearts and memories #RomanSpirit (also i wrote this thread on the shitter)
