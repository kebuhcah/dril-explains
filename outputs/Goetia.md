1/ Alright folks, here we go again. Time to crack open the big tome and unleash the truth about this so-called "Goetia" shit. Prepare to have your minds expanded like a chunky gas station hot dog in a microwave.

2/ Theres 72 spirits in the Goetia gaming sphere, and each one is part bad ass demon, part personal assistant from hell. Like a sort of an unholy, monstrous version of "Ask Jeeves." Except they're not gonna help you fix the toilet, unless by "fix" you mean "curse to eternal damnation."

3/ Imagine summoning a demon just so it could be your buddy, play Xbox with you, and spout cool karaoke lyrics from the void. Getting King Paimon to DJ your birthday would be sick as fuck, even though it's probably gonna score you an invite to the suffer-palooza after-party.

4/ Each demon has a life story, like how Gusion was a surfer dude before it became demon #11 with a real flare for fashion (unless everyone has to wear loincloths). Wouldn't be surprised if the majority of them have regrets about their past, present, and future since they now reside in the slot of the Goetia life wheel.

5/ Ultimately, these 72 goons are the Sephiroth Heroes of Geotia, only without the goddamn swords and materia thing. More like Poker nights & Cigar parties kind of dudes. Respecting the demons isn't the same as liking them (But you didn't hear it from me. You know how touchy these guys get.)

6/ So next time you're having trouble with who knows what—one of Beleth's horses got loose, or someone's talking shit about Asmodeus—the Goetia Squad is there for you. Like Discord mods who can fuck your life up in the worst way, but still offer a rare shiny Pokemon outta of the kindness in the dark pit where their heart should be.

7/Stay tuned for my upcoming guide, "How to Win Coins and Respect Demons: The Gamer's Guide to Unleashing Hell." It will give you all the pro-tips on how to master Goetia & not die in the process. Or at least, how to die on your terms, with a cold Mtn Dew in hand.

8/8 Finally, the tagline of the Goetia Squad - "You summon us, you get the crazy." Yes. you better buckle up folks. we're going for a wild demon ride to the sunset. And if a sunset includes getting tormented by ancient demons while scrolling through twitter shitposts.. call me a fucking romantic.  #GoetiaGang
