1/ Just sold my soul to the highest bidder for an exclusive guided tour down the mysterious haunted catacombs of Haskell programming. I have returned – older, wiser, and cloaked in the holy stench of monads

2/ They say learning Haskell is like tasting the sweet nectar of enlightenment, while trapping your brain in the loving embrace of a thousand furious math demons – both salvation and damnation at once, the ultimate shitposting language

3/ My followers: #WhatTheHellIsHaskell? Hold on to your hats, good people, for I shall unveil to you its secrets. Prepare to receive the intricate tapestry woven with strange symbols called "lambda functions" and the arcane magic of "type classes"

4/ First, we must acknowledge the ancient and all-powerful "pure function" – Haskell's version of an edict dictated by a Pharaoh's ghost. With it, both virgin coder and grizzled veteran shall speak the language of everlasting determinism

5/ Remember, in the kingdom of Haskell, side effects are strictly prohibited. Violators are sentenced to eternal banishment to the depths of the IO Monad, where they shall flail against the insurmountable walls of their functional cage

6/ Haskell's mantra: "All hail the faceless god of types! By its infinite wisdom, may our puny minds unite – within the rich, mystical realm of abstraction – to ascend beyond mere mortal comprehension. Amen!"

7/ As I delved deeper, feeling the immense weight of knowledge bear down, I witnessed the holy union of the Monoid and the Functor – their love dare speak its name, but cherished deeply in the hallowed halls of Haskell

8/ Upon final departure, I received a gift: my very own ghc compiler, handed down by Sir Isaac Newton himself. With it, I transcend human weakness and, at long last, join the ranks of the noble Haskell meme necromancers

9/ And so, I bid thee farewell, fellow truth-seekers. May you join me on this epic journey by invoking Cabal commands, donning the prestigious robes of Curry-Howard Isomorphism, and answering the eternal call of the lazy, but persistent, Haskell

10/ or not. That's, uh, cool too. Ol' dril ain't exactly the tech support type. I'll stick to eternal truth-dispensing in the form of piss-drinking brags and grill-age wisdom
