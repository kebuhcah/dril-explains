1/12 - let me break this down for you, folks. the big boys call it "automobile manufacturing" but its basically making big car puzzles, turning us all into pro gamers. 

2/12 - first, you enter the factory, which is a sacred zone. probably filled with ghosts of fallen car makers, haunting the machines & whispering their secrets. respect, always.

3/12 - then you got the chassis. it's the skeleton for the car, and just like the human skeleton, its 100% calcium, maybe. people probably confused chassis & Chassie a lot but thats a part of the game, baby

4/12 - what fuels the beast? well, some say "engine", but that's just a fancy way of saying "magic metal car heart." pumping life juice into big engines is a hard task and I salute the brave

5/12 - wheels = born from the tire's bosom. these crucial roundies lets the car glide around, like a divine skeater. without them theres no going from point A to B or anywhere else 

6/12 - steering? haha yeah. im no dipshit. Car seat opera with the turning thing. The masters call it "Steering Wheel" and gets you in, around, and out of trouble or traffic, if youre like me (skilled)

7/12 - behold the mighty "trilloopomorphic system," aka transmission. think of it like a loyal horse that wont let you fall off when jamming hard through the mud & rock. you can trust in it's guidance.

8/12 - the strongest among us make brakes. imagine looking a car speedin towards you n being like "hey whats the big idea." thats what these bad boys do, but to the carâ€”or something like that. it's a mystery.

9/12 - "car interiors" might sound like a cryptic IKEA item but it means so much more. It's the commitment to leather or no leather, cup-holders or no cup-holder. Plush seats, my dudes.

10/12 - ultimately, we paint these beasts: red for going fast, black for going stealth, yellow for going to the beach, etc. These prime colors define & encapsulate the cars identity

11/12 - onto public roads these wild things go, whichs an even crazier zone. cars reclaiming their right as the dominant species. how the world is before we realized the cars were always in charge.

12/12 - so thank you, noble car crafters, you monsters of metal magicks. we mortals appreciate your contribution, your work that has birthed these iron beasts so that we can race, roar and rest. amen.
