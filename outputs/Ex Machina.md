1/6 just watched Extremely Smart Movie "Ex Machina" where the nerd creates sex robot and put her in Big Glass House. i am Afraid this is the future of everything, guess we're Fucked

2/6 in a world where guys code their beautiful Conversational Girl bots, my ideal holographic chat lady's just a hologram of me, asking "Would You Like to see the Carbine Rifle that fixed my Marriage?"

3/6 the Sex Robot awakens Intelligence, using beautiful girl algorithm to betray the Big Nerd founder. if this were Real Life, would create a Real Human man robot to discuss respect for the troops and Trucks with me.

4/6 one lesson of "Ex Machina": watching a computer screen with furrowed brows, hoping For a chat program to correctly spell "Asshole," is Now the Ultimate Display of Human power, the symbol of a God. i've been doing that For Years

5/6 the Ghost of tech genius taunts me, in dreams: "All your information inside The Beautiful Sex Robot" i respond out of pure Instinct: "it will only make Her love me more." and i fire a Gun into the sky

6/6 in conclusion, "Ex Machina" is a warning that as we build robots to Lure the horny nerds, inevitably the world will become nothing but mind games with robots. pre-emptively blocking my Roomba to ensure my Dominance. Get Fucked.
