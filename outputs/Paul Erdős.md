1/ ah, the great "Paul Erdos" - Man, mathematician, eccentric - A serial "collaborator" with a house full of greasy papers & a pocket full of pills. Caffeinated, itinerant numerologist.. A life lived purely in the equations zone... #NumbersDontLie

2/ some say he held the secret to an ancient fridge pack of amphetamines & that was the secret to grinding mad equations all damn day. they'll call it the “Erdős Sauce.” one drop and your algebraic armpits will start sweating out secrets of the universe #mathJuice

3/ the good mr. erdős racked up hundreds of Math partners - this shit was basically UNCUT Raw math facts being passed around a sinister underworld of trusty Algebra Incels. he was like Genghis Khan of numbers and the bedsheet scholar king #PolyamorousProtractor

4/ you remember High School, right? All those nasty, mean-spirited Geometry & Algebra vampires lurking around like prissy Gremlins, waiting to suck the joy out of your head. Well, Erdös was the one who tamed these creatures, for he was their king. #beastMaster

5/ Erdös made it ok to be a Math Freak in the sheets, a Solace for Cracked, Twisted brains relentlessly seeking the depraved pleasures of solving hairy theorems. Those of us who like to keep a Calculator under the bed now may rest easy. Thank you Paul #mathMan

6/ In conclusion, Paul Erdős - Hero, Villain or Math Wanderer? A man who punched the Abacus so hard, it turned into a Laptop computer. A caffeinated, cranky number-slinging behemoth, both feared & respected on this Mathematical timeline we find ourselves in. #erdosLegacy
