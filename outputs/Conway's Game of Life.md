1/ just found out about this crazy lil game called "The Game of Life" and no, it's not about dreading the next dawn, buddy. It's "Conway's" baby.

2/ okay so imagine this - cells, cells as far as your screwed up mind can see. some cells alive, others dead as shit. but not just any cells, CELLULAR AUTOMATONS.

3/ my good man cOnWaY had this idea, right? he made up rules cause he thinks he's the BOSS of cells. but whatever, here they go - births, deaths, survivals, and not like ur typical monday morning.

4/ "rule one, populations soar" - more neighbors equal a NEW life, just like me calling the police after the neighbors are too damn loud. but it needs exactly 3 cells or you're in the gutter. 

5/ "rule two, death" - this ain't a game for sissies, they get choked. 4 or more cells kill themselves, population control or whatever. i call it the "go directly to jail" card

6/ "rule three, the loner blues" - if you got only 1 or less buddies, bye bye cell. me when 'friends' leave me hanging at the waffle house parking lot.

7/ "rule four, the eager beavers" - 2 or 3 happy cells? they get to stay ALIVE baby! it's like having the perfect balance of me time and bro time on Call of Duty.

8/ Now this #Conway character kept it strictly square, pixel grid style. cause he's ARTISTIC or whatever. but you can have a cellular party in hexagons or triangles and nobody even thinks to stop you. 

9/ where's the WINNER? sounds easy, but there's No real endpoint like my dates. Stable patterns, oscillators making movements, and ships just freaking flying away.

10/ So what's the point, u ask? Buddy I don't know, same reason i microwave pizza pockets just to see them explode. I guess we just love watching Life in every damn form. #GameOfLife #CellsBeWildin
