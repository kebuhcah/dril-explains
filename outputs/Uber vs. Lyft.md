1/ Uber vs Lyft: The age old battle between men who fake their names and cars that smell like fermented Sprite. Let the assesment of the mobile ride begin.

2/ Uber - a service where you enter a vehicle and the driver asks intrusive questions about your life while playing top 40 hits on repeat. Trip ussualy ends in arguing about detours.

3/ Lyft - the bastard step brother of Uber; less fancy, but better pink mustache. Asks you about your personal preferences in ice cream flavors while you grip the door handle in blind terror fearing the driver might miss a turn.

4/ Getting into an Uber feels like being trapped in a nightmare where you have to pray that the guy who’s driving the car won’t call you “Buddy” or “Terminator X.” Lyft? You're spending 20 minutes debating if "Peanut Butter Jelly Time" is copyrighted or not.

5/ Uber has performed dangerous maneuvers such as abandoning an entire city, while Lyft mostly focuses on trying to coax you into sitting in the front to enjoy a shared "fan moment" with the driver.

6/ In conclusion, both Uber and Lyft are simply two sides of the same coin. They'll transport you to your destination, but you'll pay with discomfort and inconvenience in return. And yes, both will make you question why you didn't just take the bus instead.
