1/9 ah, yes. the "Squid Game" - a harrowing program where strangers face off in contests of debts and despair, to grasp the slippery teat of Riches #NetflixAndShrill

2/9 As the players assemble, each numbering like misfit hostages that have sharted themselves in the hellscape of capitalism, yet we cheer on their torturous journey

3/9 at the core of this unforgiving struggle are games, ah, cruel games like games of our youths. tug-o-war, marbled madness, hopscotch, slap ass. all sinister now.

4/9 every victory stakes body fat dollars in to the sky, bankrolling their desperate lives.. a sick lottery. I bet they'd give anything to just score a few scratch off tickets

5/9 the mask clad evil men, reminiscent of the guy who kissed his unmasked face at a super-market just to spite me & wife, wield inexplicable power in this demented Candy Land.

6/9 Debts, laughable currency given to us by the goblin king so we may toil ceaselessly. Squid gamers illuminate the reckoning we all endure when we ask 'where's my money?'

7/9 but do not lose hope, for in the ink-black waters of despair swim unlikely alliances. our players learn the value of teamwork, and the price of a gut-shot betrayal.

8/9 so as we peer in to the labyrinth of Squid Games, we gaze at our own sunken reflections in the muck-choked tide pools of human folly. But fear not, my friends.

9/9 twas men who made the sea monsters, and their choices that feed their insatiable beasts. Remember, thou shalt not suffer a squid game to live. #SurviveTheInkWars
