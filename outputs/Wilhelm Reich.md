1/7: just found out about this guy "Wilhelm Reich" - not sure if he's a genius, madman, or both? loving how he builds Orgone boxes to trap sexy ghosts or whatever that blue stuff is.

2/7: so Reich was basically the original twit poster, inventing his own brand of psychology called "orgonomy" - it's like mr. Freud dialed to 69...also featuring cosmic plasma energy.

3/7: Ladies: if your man refuses to let you climax while wrapped in an "Orgone Accumulator", made of metal & wood layers (duh), then he has his PATHOLOGICAL character armor on today baby.

4/7: Wilhelm Reich tried to fight the government using cloudbusters, which looked like mad scientist- tier christmas trees that also drew weather control energy. owned, feds beaten+ humiliated.

5/7: the whole scientist community lampoons Reich for concocting "pseudo-science". really, what's more unscientific than denying positive Orgone radiation & then spray painting "Cuck" on my coat.

6/7: a brief moment of respect to my man Reich, who died in prison for his love of amorphous glowing energy. I, as chief poster, pour one out for you & your quest to make pure vital sex clouds.

7/7: to celebrate & honor Wilhelm Reich, I will personally spend 48 uninterrupted hours in my homemade Orgone accumulator, absorbing cosmic lifeforce energy, and flexing ass online. youâ€™re welcome.
