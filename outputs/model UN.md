1/ ah, yes. the Model UN. A realm for only the finest intellects, the children kings gathered to don their diplomat costumes & goons, discussing the imaginary discourse in one big, epoxy room. #WorldPeaceInSession

2/ these child politicos sip their Capri sun & solve fictional crisis like its nobodies business. Meanwhile i remain in dire crap & horror forgetting my neighbor's name. The weight of worldly knowledge causes me to piss & shit myself while these sages simply nod in international code

3/ no need for practical application, when the "Model" of universe peace is right here, hidden in a fukcen broom closet out back behind the high school. I weep into my hands to see these little god kings handed such power & yet... they must face the torment of high school prom

4/ age old adage which echo through halls of time, across the trembling stars: "in the model UN, one must be wary of stepping on toes, for it is often where the UN secretly hides its Big nuclear button, waiting for a foolish delegate to ignite the flames of destiny"

5/ to fully understand the model UN, we must glimpse into very nature of man itself; our primal urge to debate & quibble & nod & sway -  but in the end we all must shake hands & trade signed documents befitting of the surreal theatre of human interaction that we call "Foreign Policy"

6/ in Conclusion, let us not pity these wide eyed diplomats who choose to explore the tangled web of international cooperation, guided by the hand of their ELA teacher in a desperate bid to pad their college application. For they truly abide by their ancient creed "going places"
