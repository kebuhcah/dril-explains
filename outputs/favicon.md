1/ favicon revelation: the tiny ghosts haunting the edges of our sites, throwing off our dirtbag eyes when a multitude of tabs create hell's labyrinth

2/ i ask favicon if he likes his job: he tells me "it's a living". who could bring themselves to extinguish an entity that displays such bittersweet existentialism 

3/ just discovered favicon is short for "favorite icon" and NOT "fascist invasion." the webmaster laughs as i scramble to undo the cataclysm of misunderstanding I've propagated

4/ we pack our bags and migrate to the favicon paradise, a sanctum for those, resilient to the tornado of misinformation brewed by THE ONLINE. Tiny, 16x16 pixels - masters of the small and the significant

5/ hours of contemplation, an icon of strength born from the depths of ones own ability to streamline; a simple man, transformed into the shining beacon of purpose that is favicon. 

6/ in conclusion: we are at the mercy of the favicon, their unwavering 16x16 presence guiding us through the serpentine bowels of the web. all hail our minuscule overlord. May we always keep the faith, unwavering and favicon strong. #FaviconForever
