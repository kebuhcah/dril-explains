1/6 Alright idiots, strap in—time to unwrap the enigma of Sun Masayoshi AKA 孫正義, a man who claims to be some Business Billionaire while living in his invisible money compound. #sunmasayoshi #invisiblemoneycompound

2/6 First off, Sun runs this thing called "SoftBank Group" (what the fuck is that even, sounds like a velvet pillow scheme). Dude's stacking cash from internet-n-brains of robots. Half man, half wallet. The future is here, morons. #softbank #velvetpillowscheme

3/6 Apparently, Sun once lost 70 BILLION in a day (for tax evasion purposes?). Couldn't be me, no sir; never permit the government to scam even a single dollar from my greasy-ass pockets. The nerve of these #billionaires... #taxevasion #onetruememelord

4/6 Rumor has it, Sun envisions a future where humans live side-by-side with robots (...as if we ain't ALREADY). Watches too many movies if you ask me. Somebody get this guy the DVD collection of 'Terminator' to set him straight. #robotfuture #therobotening

5/6 孫正義's world includes pigs that fly, infinite batteries, and a "robot revolution." Uh, hey Sun, get in line buddy! Just last week I told my mother I'd "change the world" before slamming a whole pizza down my throat. Dream big, chumps. #pizza #changetheworld

6/6 In conclusion, Sun Masayoshi sits atop his castle of imaginary dollars, laughing at our plebian suffering as he feeds on the marrow of robot bones. And just like any good villain, I now challenge him to mutual combat at dawn. Memelord vs. Billionaire. Bring it. #finalbattle
