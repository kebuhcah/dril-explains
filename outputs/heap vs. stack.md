1/7: listening to the ogres arguing outside my window about some "stack" and "heap" business- as the lord of online, it is my duty to educate myself and clarify this mess to the masses. #learnsometech

2/7: "stack" - a pile of organized data that only lets you touch the filthy topmost item. very respectful to chaos haters. "heap" - an unruly moshpit of data, fighting for control as they claw at each other. absolute primal fear. #computers

3/7: in the passionate embrace of the Stack, each new data amigo slots in like a greasy hot dog. old one slides out with minimal fuss. no romance in this machine; the Stack is all business. #stacksonstacks

4/7: meanwhile, the Heap is a mysterious playpen of death. a nightmarish pit where data gremlins fight to the death to see who gets stored. hard to wrap my big head around this one without feeling dizzy #heapoftrouble

5/7: stack peeps and heap freaks arguing in my yard all day. My neighbors hate my ass now. Hiding in my own damn house; tearing up my clothes in fits of rage #hellonearth

6/7: to silence the eternal war between stackinos and heapsters, I will be merging their dogmas into a single, powerful system called "Htack." May peace and tranquility overcome the digital realm #htackrevolution

7/7: just learned I have been discussing memory allocation this whole time. thought i was arguing for good yard storage etiquette. it's still important damn it. gonna lie down for a while now #yardwars #heapvstack
