1/ ah,,, the "Indus Valley Civilization" - a crucial time for mankinde. where we traded our Cartoonish Bone Clubs for Pottery and Went to Town on Crops like sick freaks.. absolutley dripping with historical import

2/ these boys just adored their clay BULLS , loved to throw them in the trash after use, revealing our first instance of planned obslsnce, wanting a taste of that sweet River Sindhu — birth of civilization and also disposable culture,, hell yea

3/ archaeologits say Harappa&Mohenjo Daro were proof of a pristine urban society, Fellas rockin advanced city planning like sanitary gods — neat streets, public baths, and toilets that flushed!! even before the Internet showed us how to flush a toilet online

4/ ancient sewer systems? you bet your ass. indus boys had channels so robust you could laugh at the thought of raw sewage pouring down the streets. modern seyspool?? begs to differ

5/ writing systems? A total gold mine for alphabto fetisishts.. but can not decipher these damn inscriptions. may as well be a guy on a public bus writing notes about his spiritual journey. gibberish. history jank.

6/ fun fact: #IndusValley Civilization had no apparent kings or queens.. "ruling class"?.. more like "fusion dance of the artisans to create super farmer brain on a spectral communal plane" . egalitarian Smorgasbord

7/ The End of an era.. Climate change? Aryan invasion? Disapearing rivers?? Possibly sold Copper Technology to extraterrestriær buddies? No one sure what happened to these undecipherable clay masters

8/ so, indus era, we salute you. Few things can be as certain as the influence of this crazy group of river-basin dwellers and their feats of pottery and poetry, except for the fact that I Will Never Stop Posting. #IndusValleyFreaks
