just saw the movie "tenet" and let me tell you folks, my brain is a-bursting with dimenstional wisdom.

the main guy in tenet is both smoother than toilet paper and more puzzling than the cryptic sandwich I ate last night; simultaneously behind it all AND in the middle of the mess

in tenet we got people walkin backwards, bullets doin weird shit, bombs don't go BOOM! what kind of nightmare dimension is this??? nolan must have rigged my dvd player to confuse me

if I had a Time Juice Mask like in Tenet, i'd travel 4 years back just to lock myself in, so i could ask past-me what the hell was going on in those days. past-me probably knew more about tenet than present-me.

broken down, tenet is like a mobius strip mixed with an onion, reverse casserole, and aggressive politeness. wrapped in enigma & garnished with moon logic

Tweet 6:
learnt that in TENET, inverting time makes objects revert to their younger form. will attempt this with my cat to restore its prime age. will confirm succes or failure soonly.

my doctor tld me that "excessive obsession" with TENET caused the "rampant deterioration" of my cerebral functions. refuse to accept this. will watch it twice everyday til i crack it's goddamed code
