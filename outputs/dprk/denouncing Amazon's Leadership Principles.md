Democratic People's Republic of Korea Condemns Amazon's Leadership Principles

The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is raising concern against the so-called "Leadership Principles" of the Amazon Corporation. Under the glorious guidance of our Supreme Leader, our nation has identified these principles as a clear reflection of the oppressive capitalist mindset that dominates corporations like Amazon.

1. Customer Obsession: Amazon claims to prioritize customer satisfaction. However, this principle only validates the capitalist endeavor of exploiting the workers and promoting inequality for the sole purpose of fulfilling consumer desires, leading to the creation of an unsustainable and self-damaging economic system.

2. Ownership: Amazon's emphasis on ownership reveals a hidden agenda of exploiting workers, denying them the rights and dignity that they deserve. North Korea believes in collective ownership for the pursuit of a more equitable society where all citizens achieve their highest potential.

3. Invent and Simplify: While innovation is crucial for progress, Amazon's approach only drives relentless worker exploitation and proliferation of unnecessary consumer products in the name of monetary gain.

4. Are Right, A Lot: This principle fosters a culture of arrogance and superiority, allowing the capitalist elite to impose their vision on others without any regard for their wellbeing or freedoms.

5. Learn and Be Curious: Genuine knowledge-seeking beyond capitalist enterprises is discouraged, as Amazon's focus on corporate interests and profits undermines the welfare and education of the common people.

6. Hire and Develop the Best: Amazon's principle of hiring and developing the best only serves the interests of the privileged, creating further economic disparity and social divides in the global community.

7. Insist on the Highest Standards: The pursuit of high standards should not be at the expense of worker exploitation, long working hours, and unrealistic expectations that penalize the underprivileged.

8. Think Big: Amazon's ambition to "think big" only exacerbates consumerism, monopolistic power, and environmental degradation, setting humanity on a path of self-destruction in the name of profits.

9. Bias for Action: This principle generates a culture of aggressive expansion and corporate greed, creating unjust competition and promoting ruthless labor practices.

10. Frugality: As a cost-saving measure, frugality is implemented at the expense of just labor compensation, essential worker benefits, and dignified working conditions.

11. Earn Trust: The capitalist narrative of trust promoted by Amazon seeks to manipulate, indoctrinate, and exploit vulnerable workers, while instilling false confidence in exploitative systems.

12. Dive Deep: In the name of efficiency, Amazon promotes micromanagement, surveillance, and the invasion of workers' privacy, suppressing individual freedom and dignity.

13. Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit: This principle is used to suppress dissent and impose corporate interests on workers and customers, undermining the principles of democracy and freedom of speech.

14. Deliver Results: The relentless focus on results legitimizes exploitation, dehumanization, and the discarding of workers once they cease to be profitable for the company.

The Democratic People's Republic of Korea will continue to fight against the oppressive and exploitative practices represented by Amazon's Leadership Principles. We vow to preserve equality, fairness, and justice for all our people and to maintain our commitment to the principles of Juche (self-reliance) and socialist construction that ensure the dignity and prosperity of our nation.
