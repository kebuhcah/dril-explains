let me ask you this. do i "fake" my knee going red when i slam it on the ground after pumping my friends full of unseen power? is it an illusion that the ref doesn't call "time out"? does life imitate wrestling or wrestling imitate life?

polite reminder that every time a wrestler props another man up on his back, only to slam them down and create havoc, the planet inches closer to its cosmic destiny. that's right idiots, wrestling is the only truth left in our god forsaken world

imagine having the audacity to challenge the brute strength of grown men in tights punching and kicking each other, seemingly for our entertainment. fake? false. it is a gesture of dominance and hope that grips the soul of all humanity

the only thing "fake" about wrestling is the despicable lies that course through my veins everytime someone dares to undermine the sanctity of a choreographed drop kick. I'm sickened. I will defend this sacred mode of expression until my dying breath

so in conclusion, if you ignoramuses still think pro wrestling is fake, remember: the tactics used in it have nothing short of reshaped the fibers of the universe. the rings of saturn have bent, the planets aligned; history will never be the same. good luck recovering from that one, assholes. #WrestlingIsReal
