1/ Ah yes, the noble art of slicing the devil's minions. "Demon Slayer": the Anime that takes us on a journey through the ass backwards world of sword wielding, mask-owning, sibling-protecting delinquents.
 
2/ Main guy's name is Tangela, or something like that. His ultimate goal is to stop being a chump, and slay every goddamn demon in existence (and turn his sister back into a human, in the process) which i, personally, extremely respect.

3/ Sis got bit by demon, became one, and now Tanglewood must haul her ass around. She hides out in a cute lil bamboo basket, like some kind of ridiculous vampire easter bunny.

4/ I will not forget to mention the CLOWN foolishness that is "Breaths". Takes a big whiff of air and suddenly you're slicing the god-given universe in two. air = good for lungs, not turning sword moves into flashy nonsense.

5/ The gang of delinquents grows, so does the chaos. A determined misogynist pig man and a lovable piss baby join the ranks of the demon hunting buffet. Never a dull moment in this sick carnival of hell whisperers.

6/ Now ive seen many commentaries accusing me, dril, of not comprehending the rich, thematic nuances of Demon Slayer. This is bullshit. I just prefer my demons in the gooey form, of a misspent youth slathered in Hennessy & gasoline, as god intended.

7/Sidebar: Everybody is crazy about the flashy demon lady with her violin playing blood attacks. If you ask me, The people running this godforsaken Twitter platform could use a few lessons in Demon Slayer tactics. Ban that symbol character and unleash the beast.

8/ In conclusion, Demon Slayer: good wholesome fun for the family, if your family happens to enjoy the dismemberment of grotesque hell-spawn. 9/10, would slam a 6er of Monster Energy Drinks while binging again. Thank you for your time. #DemonSlayer #AnimeExpertsOnly
