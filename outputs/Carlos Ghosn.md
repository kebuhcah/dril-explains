1. it has come to my attention that many in this putrid hellscape require enlightenment on the enigmatic figure of "CarLos GHosn". buckle up, assholes, as i unfurl the serpentine tale of the c-suite daredevil

2. Carlos G, the "auto exec phantom", was a high flying CEO at the trifecta, nay, the triumvirate of major car brands: NISSan, REanault, and MITSuBISHI. a veritable Fast & the Furious of the corporate world, minus the criminal underground

3. this business warlord had to face the cruel hands of fate when the gods of the law demanded tribute. tax evasion, they claimed, was his debauchery. but our chrome cowboy would not bow, for his spirit was forged in the flames of wild capitalism

4. Busted out of a Japanese prison, hiding in a goDdamned musical box. Scooping that sweet taste of liberty like a scoop of rocky road ice cream, with a cherry of defiance on top . most pitiful of all, they said he was not authorized to live in lebanon

5. the world may call him fugitive, criminal, thieving scum of the bastard class, but lets get Real, the powerful aroma of chaos he exudes makes us cower as we gaze into the abyss of his high-stakes roller-coaster existence

6. who among us does not dream to be the Carlos Ghosn of whatever dark path we walk down? A force to be reckoned with, taking destiny by its greasy balls in defiance of those who dare to weigh us down. Ride on, chrome cowboy, Ride on.

7. legally i must clarify once agaiN, that i do not issue endorsements nor condone evasion or misconduct of any kind. however, i am pleased to fuel the insatiable hunger for lore that permeates within my fellow men- and this my friends, if a tasteful snack.
