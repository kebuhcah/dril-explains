1/5 ah, the "6th" Dalai Lama - a big shot back in his time, ruling the world of spiritual awakenings and teenage poetry. keep whining about #Mindfulness, i suppose...

2/5 listen up folks, the 6th Dalai Lama only wanted to show all the haters. He knew that being a badass rebel poet could ooze charisma & break religious norms... no need for monkhood if you're woke enough. take notes

3/5 Tsangyang Gyatso, that's my man! tavern writer by day, drunken debauchery enthusiast by night. A true libertine in the hallowed halls of the Dalai Lama club. The Lads' Lama, if you will.

4/5 If this incarnation reached clarity while downing beers and penning bawdy poems, who are we to deny his genius? Maybe the real path to enlightenment is wine, women & song. Or are we too weak to embrace this sacred wisdom? Turn up & find out.

5/5 Next time somebody tells u to "live your truth", remember the "often forgotten" 6th Dalai Lama – spiritual master and sensual provocateur – and tell 'em: "I'm just channeling my inner Tsangyang Gyatso." #Namaste
