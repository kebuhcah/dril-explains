1/ ah yes, Forever 21. the store that gleefully refuses to grow old; shackling itself to its prime against the inexorable march of time, like an effervescent peter pan bound in sequins n denim

2/ had they named it "Temporary 21," it would have eradicated the false premise that they were indeed, planted forever in a state of prime youth. But no, they persisted. Forever? can't wait for the heat death of the universe to test this notion.

3/ they cornered the market not only on youthful fashion, but also on the unshackling essence of indecision that lives on in your dresser, with those poor bastard clothes tags hanging on for dear life, like sailors clinging to wreckage in a storm

4/ The false promises of an eternal age 21 manifested in a realm with hues comparable to a box of crayons left out in the sun. somehow enchanting and blinding simultaneously. "Forever 21" today! says the sign, as I brave yet another storm of despair to purchase 5 graphic tees.

5/ the whispering allure of buying clothes at “good enough” prices to be cast into a pile without ever being worn. few dare to resist. as u walk in the store, u become a participant in a chaos play of a time loop that'll not let u grow, 21 - it's grip slithers around u like a snake.

6/ historians will study Forever 21 as the pinnacle of our dementia; humanity's inability to resolve the great damage we inflict on our own age by trying again n again to capture youth while I, am assailed with yet another offensive shirt that says "Caffeine Queen" in cursive

7/ in the end, we all march toward the grand abyss, seeking to revitalize our ancient souls within the arms of a store that promises to keep our vitality captive. but it is not truly age we wish to evade; no, friend, it is simply our cursed fate of inevitable shirtlessness. Louder!
