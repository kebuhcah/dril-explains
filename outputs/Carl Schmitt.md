mr. schmitt says we're all just playin around till we face a Real Enemy. the world is a video game my brother. respawn when you die. gamers shall inherit the earth.

politics is just like picking teams 4 a damn baseball game according to carl. now i know how the boys in congress feel when they whip out their mitts and prepare for a good bipartisan ol fashion scrimmage #BallGamePolitics

hittin the liquid schmitt, injecting carl wisdom straight into my brain veins. modern man grovels at the feet of "scary times", but for me, it just makes my posting stronger than ever. bring on the chaos, u conniving ghouls

as the ultimate poster-guru, carl schmitt taught us to embrace the foes so we might elevate our interactions beyond simple follies. perhaps one day the chips at the ol' casino will fall and humanity can cash em in for Maximum Online Presence. godspeed carl

Tweet 6 (conclusion):
in conclusion, schmitt opened my eyes to the game we r all playin; maybe this is life, maybe its politics. but whatever it is, it makes for damn good content & I will not resist the siren song. i am the poster-Man come to life, guided by carl's philosophic glow
