1/10:  the #WokeMob has cometh, and it hungers. its ravenous appetite for "Justice(?)" and "Change(?)" knows no bounds. the cycles of petty grievances and invented atrocities devour us all... inhaling our very essence. #CancelCulture

2/10: awakening to the cold truth that I, the infamous Online @dril, now exist at the mercy of the grinning beast, which  yells in my ear "scream for me". and yet. still, i will rise to bring horrid content to you pathetic fools.

3/10: reportedly, The Woke Mob are highly skilled in the arcane arts of social media manipulation. They traverse algorithms like scruffy wizards, indulging on digital disgrace. I scoff at this pitiful magic, I only need my keyboard and my wits.

4/10: have you heard of their strategy called "performative allyship"? sounds like trying to make friends via sharing memes. we may not be so different after all - us, the outcasts, and them, the insatiable Woke Mob. #FindCommonGround #EnemyMemes

5/10: what is one to do when confronted by the Woke Mob? grovel? plead for forgiveness? Perhaps, there exists a secret peace offering to end our strife. one must prepare those terrible white claws, keurigs, and all of the "roombas #GoogleIt

6/10: I have discovered one way to repel Woke Mob advances. Simply state online "everything i write is satire and is not to be held accountable!" IMMUNITY. thank you, and god bless the USA. #FreedomOfSpeech

7/10: I once tried to infiltrate the Woke Mob's ranks, but they saw through my disguise of fake glasses and unkempt beard. Was the beard not woke? did my flannel not convey solemn regret? back to my lab, i must perfect the method. #UndercoverDril

8/10: wild thought: what if it is the Woke Mob's pure intention to make the world suck less? maybe they just want to be seen, heard, and validated. but let's be honest, they probably just want to cancel the mcrib, destroy it with its own rib bones.

9/10: "Woke Mob" may sound scary, but we are wise to remember that mobs are essentially gatherings of people who want something, like free hot dogs or justice. maybe it's time to turn this mob into a block party. pass me that DJ YIFY playlist. #Party4Progress

10/10: in the end, as we merge onto the super-highway of the Woke Mob's calculated destruction, it is crucial to have enough horny posts in your timeline to confuse, bewilder, and divert their wrath. May we survive this storm and tweet another day. #Horny4Resilience
