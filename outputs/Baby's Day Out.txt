1/ im just going to come out and say it. Baby's Day Out? absolutely twisted. an absolute bonkers piece of cinema. a tiny little man doing adult things against all rules. 

2/ first off, the baby escapes from these expert kidnappers with the brain capacity of a can of soup. the parents paid a fortune for those toy law enforcement agents. clearly overpriced. 

3/ and the baby, evading the grasp of these "evil" men, proceeds to pull some Absolute Jimmies Freaker stunts. Baby Walker. Baby Climber. Baby Bus Traveller. master of all trades. 

4/ who's this intrepid baby? what mysterious force guides him through the city, toying with kidnappers and causing chaos? could it be...a GHOST BABY? *X-FILES THEME PLAYS* 

5/ Baby's Day Out isn't just a film, it's an experience. it's the pinnacle of child-centric jazz chaos. it speaks to the inner baby within us all, that says "i want to mess with these stupid idiots"

6/ in the end, Baby's Day Out truly brings us back to the basics. yes, it's a movie about a baby, but it's also a reminder that we must fear no obstacle, no matter our size or age.

7/ yore telling me that this swanky kid outwitted CAGEY MEN wwhile never spilling a drop of the leaking diaper??! Obscene...How can i acquire the skills &amp; finesse to be like Da Baby of The Day Out?

8/ there's no finale more explosive than a baby on a crane. you've heard of Spider-Man. you've heard of Batman. but have you heard of CRANE BABY? where's the love for this anti-villain hero?

9/ in conclusion, Baby's Day Out is an untamed thrill ride that knows no bounds, it's the fabric from which we are all woven. and if you don't appreciate it, well. it's your loss, friends.

10/10 Baby's Day Out is to be respected, if not cherished. if you see a baby on the street today, give them a knowing nod, a subtle salute. they understand things we'll never begin to comprehend
