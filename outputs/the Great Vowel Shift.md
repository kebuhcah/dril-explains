1/8 strap in folks as i dip my toes into the septic tank of modern linguistics, a harsh desert where vowels shift and sounds get fucked up beyond recognition. i present to you.. The Great Vowel Shift

2/8 long ago vowels were humble creatures. the a's, the e's, and the o's, sittin' together by the campfire, singin' tunes & sharin' laughs. then one fateful day, some jackass decided they should start Shiftin' around. pure, unadulterated Chaos ensued.

3/8 oh did i fail to mention? this wasn't a one-time grand shift - this shit happened in waves. the sea of vocalic mayhem relentlessly pounded the shores of the english language like a pissed off Godzilla stepping on a Lego city.

4/8 tHe ExPeRtS say the Shift started around 1350 or something. probably the same year they invented bowler hats and canned beans, totally fucking over polite conversation. coincidence? i think not.

5/8 along with the great vowel migration came certain tribal disputes. the i's and u's competed for territory, pushing their sounds nastily unto one another. my history book calls it "Tension Between Front & Back High Vowels." i call it a brutal war on the english soul.

6/8 the Shift stretched itself across centuries, like a fat cat leisurely blocking the dawn of untainted language. and in its wake it spat out the twisted vowels we lazily drone today without a shred of respect.

7/8 i'm not one for conspiracies, but i suspect Big Vowel Shift was pushed by the Letter Y's corporate lobby. bastards. they knew vowels going haywire would thrust the forgotten Y into the spotlight of language, and they saw dollar signs.

8/8 in conclusion, folks, this so-called "Great" Vowel Shift sullied our noble language faster than an online troll can soil a comment section. i weep for those simpler days when a, e, i, o, and u respected one another... and sometimes y.
