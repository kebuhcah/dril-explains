1/12: the fools gather round the 'puter, joyfully basking in the glow of MMORPGs. Internet swords and fake ass armor, the battle cry of nerds seeking a higher plane of existence

2/12: my wife screeches at me, "stop playing Elf games & spending our life savings on magic coins." The mind reels. The final bastion of culture, the epicenter of truly immersive role playing and she dares question my pilgrimage?

3/12: MMO players know the true power of "grind". A meditative state where one is at peace with the monotonous clickity clack of skipping through dialogue. the real world distorts, and im living rent & nut free in the Land of Lestros

4/12: quests & dungeons: the endless thrill ride of body slamming mobs like the Goblins of Teronox, as the cheer of my clan echoes in our headsets: true camaraderie. The bond eternal, until server maintenance fcking destroys my social life

5/12: Im max lvl, decked in the highest tier gear. The bards now sing songs of my crazy deeds. a Zero in real life, but a Hero in these pixelated realms. The joy of digital conquest... until the next xpac where i'll be worthless garbage again

6/12: MMORPGS - a vibrant ecosystem of brilliant devs & scam artists looming just beneath the surface. we scream and weep as the new updates utterly destroys our playtime, while our blood turns to cold sweat as we await the next "fix"

7/12: PvP - of what value is one realm without the challenge of warfare? the fires of as many internet wars burn thru the night as alliances rise, and friendships are absolutely pulverized by strategic griefing & witty shit talk

8/12: MMORPG economy: a labyrinthine structure of buying, selling and trading "goods" that are, in fact, mere figments of ones imagination. Im up to my eyeballs in virtual debt, yet you will not feed my addiction by projecting judgement, thank you

9/12: crafting, the cornerstone of any self-respecting game. Whittling away human existence as we create virtual trinkets for those in our digital universe -- “Whimpered the blacksmith, toiling away into the night, I Shall Craft.”

10/12: sweet sweet loot. gearing, farming & exchanging epic tales of our conquests upon the fragments of our miserable reality, shapeshifting into armchair warriors blinded by the glow of monitors & the only glory we may ever know

11/12: the noobs - a reviled but necessary swarm of uncertainty. the "fresh blood" of MMOs. will they grow into powerful allies? Or spiral into total irrelevance? A roll of the virtual dice dictates their fate — who too, ours

12/12: in summation, MMORPGs: a digital odyssey of wizards, warriors & wage slaves beholden to a realm that is purely the echoes of a madman's fractured imagination. live in the grind, for tomorrow, we may be banned.
