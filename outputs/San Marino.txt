1/ ah, yes. san marino. the ancient fortress of gory, where the mighty kings of history battled for torridorvian sovreignity. King of the Mountain as the song from the times of old tells.. or somthjing like that

2/ nestled in the bosom of italy, San Marino is the smallest and loldest republic. it has managed to survive for millennia, evading the hands of this turbulent world. much like the incredible and elusive cockroach

3/ for such a tiny speck of nation, San Marino's got it all, baby. power; pristige; fortresses the currency, "Titanum" named after the sweet sweet sound of clanging titanic shits

4/ their flag has a neet bird on it too wich I personalrey like. Yes good taste. The bird whispers: "do not fuck with our micronation, thank you"- san marino.. listen close enuf and you'll hear it

5/ to keep the cogs of the marino-machine ticking the economy is expertly sustained by a steady diet of pocket antiques pawnings, stamps collecting and sales of the finest medieval weapons. a true tour de force

6/ in conclusion, San Marino is a mystery wrapped in an enigma ensconced in a riddle i remember my ancestors must think i have a brain disease to think of such a small nation to concern my day to daey with. god bless them. god bless.
