1/47 Feelin like a true worm for having to deal with the unholiest of Grails ,"NYC Broker Fees". If you do not know what this is, my sincerest apologies for unveiling this steaming carnival of bullshit.

2/47 "Broker Fee" is a fee you pay in tribute to the almighty Lord of Rat Whispers â€“ the Broker. This lesser demon schedules apartment viewings and does jack shit while raking in a cool cash supply fueled by city goons who crave brick pallets to live in.

3/47 i confidently stride into the Broker's lair & Shout "i Refuse to indulge Crime. No fees for a humble man of Tweets and Prayers" The broker just says "Well then good luck finding a place" and continues to organize his hoard of bribes from those who have bent the knee

4/47 We've got empty luxury condos with brooding shadow-dwellers on the top half of Manhattan, and everyone forking over broker fees like admission to a haunted rollercoaster ride down here. Have we built a cathedral only to find ourselves in Hell?

5/47 So i find the one House in this City of malice that claims theres no fee for dealing with a broker. Single tear rolls down my cheek. Ushered in 2 sign the lease by the "No Fee" Broker. Pull a sick crossbow move, and take him as a human shield. Leave chaos in my wake.

6/47 Searching for apartments online is the equivalent of tossing your personal information into a hungry blender. It's a buffet for these broker ghouls to contact you and pitch their overpriced "masterpieces" with washer dryers that make godlike groans at night.

7/47 The broker, like the toll troll, returns from a 500-year-long fever dreamscape into our society, eager to consume our unhappiness in exchange for exorbitant slabs of income. Reveal yourself, specter, and free us from your pit of deception

8/47 I will no longer remain silent about the NYC Broker Fee menace. It is time for us to rise, to put all these grifters in their rightful place, at the burnt out Wendy's parking lot, swapping dastardly stories around a barrel fire together with their grime-loving brethren.

9/47 in conclusion, my quest to defeat the dreaded demon "nyC BRoker Fee" hath led me only to a deeper pit of despair & unending torment in the form of crushed dreams & empty pockets. Good luck & God Bless to any who dare take up this tragic mantle. i have entered hell. #NoFeeZone
