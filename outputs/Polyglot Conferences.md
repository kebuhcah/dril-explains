1/ ah, the decadent POLYGLOT conference. the noble gathering of linguists and language enthusiasts convening in the hallowed halls of unintelligibility.

2/ they say it's a room full of 1000 voices all communicating fluently, but to the blind ears of a simple monoglot such as I, it sounds like one huge cacophony of absolutely wild bullshit. we must respect it

3/ asking a polyglot what their favorite language is like asking a mother to choose her favorite child. it is a heinous act that should be punished by having your mouth forcibly sewn shut with the words "je ne sais quoi" imprinted on your face.

4/ the ultimate flex is not even giving a damn about the conference agenda, but instead strolling through the hallowed halls wearing a 'rosetta stone' t-shirt, screaming "yes i speak languages too," in flawless esperanto while liberally salting snacks

5/ the economy is crumbling, but who will save us? the hidden government of Polyglots, lying in the shadows, armed with the secret knowledge of how to say "economic crisis" in over 25 languages. jack-hammers to break down the Tower of Babel. utterly POWERFUL.

6/ polyglot conferences also function as a secret gathering ground for the world's top-tier spies. catch a glimpse of mi-6 operatives brushing up on their klingon skills, so that they may decipher the frenzied whispers of their enemies in their own invented tongues

7/ imagine walking into a room where every corner produces a symphony of tongues, only for you to be entranced by the universal language of incomprehensible twitter memes. the polyglot conference, just another cog in the all-encompassing orb of internet's true dialect
