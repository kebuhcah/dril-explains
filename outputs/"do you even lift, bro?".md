1/ Ah, the dreaded inquiry... "do you even lift, bro?"—A phrase designed to cast shame and doubt upon all who dare to engage in any form of arm motion. The mantra of the gym philosopher, the motto of the gains goblin.

2/ And so I am asked... "dril, do you hoist the iron, like a sort of muscle alchemist, mutating mere metal into pulsating manflesh?" I smirk, knowing my my secret continues to devastate those who dare to challenge my strength chronicles.

3/ For it is less about the physical act of lifting, of these grotesque slabs of bulk—who in truth, are no match for a superior intellect—and more about lifting the soul...ascending to divine realms of pure strength, free of mortal weight.

4/ The essence of a "bro" is at the heart of it all. Does one truly become one's brother by the shared ritual of transforming dumbbells into brawn; or does brotherhood manifest in the profound act of matching wits and swapping tales of conquest?

5/ This inquiry—"do you even lift, bro?"—it is as old as time itself. Cavemen grunting at each other, challenging for dominance with primitive bicep curls. Romans sizing up their compatriots in the gymnasiums of antiquity. The cycle persists.

6/ And yet, in face of these challenges, these desperate pleas for validation, I remain steadfast. For to lift is to embrace the labyrinthine struggle of man&mldr; and to bro is to rise above it.

7/ In conclusion, I LIFT. I LIFT my soul, my spirit, and my intellect. Does that make me a bro? Mayhaps... But I confess, in the annals of dril's mighty history—whether I've ever truly engaged in the hallowed rites of the squat and deadlift...that secret, I shall take to my grave.
