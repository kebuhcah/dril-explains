1/ just found out about "omae wa mou shindeiru" & folks, let me tell u, i am unironically annihilated by the sheer power of this ancient Japanese roasting

2/ The phrase, transcending both time & space, slams you with a fact so hard that you, ur children & ur god damn dog dont even know ur already dead. it's a classic power move, really.

3/ saying "omae wa mou shindeiru" to unsuspecting people in heated arguments is like unwrapping a semi-illegal weapon, a diplomatic declaration of "you f*cking asked for it, buddy," as you safely sit on your throne of bones

4/ truth is we could all learn from this phrase â€“ by the time you realize how profoundly destroyed you are, it's so late that u have no choice but to embrace the sweet sweet taste of oblivion without any resistance at all

5/ i encourage every scoundrel to commit "omae wa mou shindeiru" to memory & use it as a tool for emotional dispatch, a hidden ace up your sleeve in your evil little arsenal 

6/ in response to those asking, I am already making plans on how to integrate "omae wa mou shindeiru" in my daily life, as the ultimate conversation ender, the emergency eject button when shit goes down, start to praying folks

7/ to end this humble thread, let me just say i applaud the poetry of the "omae wa mou shindeiru" philosophy - realizing you have been destroyed only in the moment after receiving the blow, now please leave me alone to ponder my life choices
