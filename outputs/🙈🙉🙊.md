1/ in this day & age of shit posting, we are presented with The Three Wise Monkeys: ğŸ™ˆğŸ™‰ğŸ™Š. the Seers of Online, ruling our eCommerce lives with cryptic gestures - announcing their presence

2/ the first prophet, See No Evil ğŸ™ˆ, urging us to renounce the never-ending parade of grotesque JPEGs on our screens; shielding eyes from unwarranted FaceBook club invitations and unwanted NFTs

3/ in the internet jungle, Hear No Evil ğŸ™‰ reigns supreme; sounds off about turning off sinister Podcasts whispering capitalist trends in ones ear, and ceasing the autoplay Videos birthed from the depths of hell

4/ Speak no Evil ğŸ™Š stands by to enforce - providing a reminder to refrain from adding our wretched takes and blasphemous jpegs to the cesspool of replies. a custodian of the goddamn dignity to keep our mouth shut

5/ together they stand, the Three Wise Monkeys, ğŸ™ˆğŸ™‰ğŸ™Š, protectors of the internet arena ensuring we resist Evil's grasp upon our feeble souls. great karmic tech support

6/ and so, we are humbly reminded of our silent digital vows to uphold the holy three tenants. am i a hero for knowing this? Maybe. But it isn't important unless you think it is #StayWoke #MonkeyWise
