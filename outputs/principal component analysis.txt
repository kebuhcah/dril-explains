1/ ah yes . principal component analysis, my old friend. the divine method for exposin g the powerful underbelly of data dimensions. let us venture. #PCA

2/ imagine a giant slab of data, crushed under the vice grip of tyranny known as dimensionality. PCA absolutely destroys it , so it can be read by Beautiful Human Minds #DataLiberator

3/ pivoting axes in inscrutable mercy, PCA discovers "hidden meaning" by trapping variance of infinity data into finite realm. "Eigen fellows," we call them, "serve us your knowledge" #EigenPower

4/ correlation matrix, rife with incestuous Eigen Drama. data points whispering to each other on their mechanical battlefield of lies. Dimensions quake in their boots. #ForbiddenDataConnections

5/ so the data is rotated, extracted, and handed out on a silver platter. a humble statistician speaks - "thine scalings, sirs, of mighty eigenvectors lift the blessed Eigen values." #HonourTheEigens

6/ covariate lovers, raging in glorious unison, I beseech thee - Principal Component Analysis is the gory tool we wield in the pursuit of dominance over dimensionality. be still our savage hearts. #Vengeance4Dimensionality

7/ now cleansed of obscure variables, the Data Child radiates its Purest Information. “Goodbye father,” It whispers. Adieu. Our dimensional burden eased, We ascend to Statistics Valhalla. #PCAascension

8/8 Thus concludes my sacred desecration of PCA, the mother of us all. Bless be our contorted data dimensions, may they serve as guiding lights in the furious storm of Information. #HailPCA #ThreadEnds
