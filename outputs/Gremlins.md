1/ Ah, the majestic Gremlins, born from thy mysterious Mogwai— heed my warning, for they hold the forbidden science of pure Chao's--Vexation to mankind in a 1980s blockbuster movie.

2/ MOGWAI--God's canvas of creation, these tiny freaks can morph into chaos bastards on a dime— it simply requires the holy trinity of mayhem: food after midnight, direct sunlight, and a mere splish splash of H20.

3/ Feeding after midnight— an inscrutable, reckless taboo. You transgress the law of time and witness the gremlin's metamorphosis. Spikes above their heads, cacophony beneath their breaths, their menace now unfettered.

4/ WATER — the gremlin's arcane elixir. Apply it externally, and observe the nightmare sprout, unfathomable and prolific— like a time share salesman hellbent on selling your family into eternal damnation.

5/ The SUN— known by scientists and demons alike as "the big death ray," bringing utter annihilation to these goblin beasts. Take note, for this is the Off Button to their unyielding spree of debauchery.

6/ Spielberg & Dante— the dark architects who unleashed and shackled these beasts within an unholy vessel of cinematic tapestry. Do they hold the keys to the gremlin's final defeat, or do they revel in our mortal undoing?
