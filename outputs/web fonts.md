1/ ah, the forbidden knowledge. web fonts - vast universe of absurd letter galleries; the elite dowager's banquet for web aesthetes, drawing in its succulent net unsuspecting font freaks like moths to the opulent flame of typographic sin

2/ in the primordial womb of the internet, a concept was forged-- a thought of pure egotism, incited by the manic thirst for "style". the web designer, a creature with an unquenchable hunger for artistic expression, demanded a richer palette

3/ no longer would Arial and Times New Roman be the tyrannical wardens of the screen. the gates of font prison were SMASHED. serifs and sans-serifs escaped, flooding the internet with an unholy deluge of carnage.

4/ so we have web fonts: fonts that dwell in the dark cybers of the online sphere, ready to adorn web pages and feast on its more well-designed brethren. Google Fonts, Adobe Fonts, all poised to corrupt and entice, eager to blend the virtual ink with our dwindling sanity

5/ some say it's just harmless expression; others believe we tamper with powers ancient and vile... the line between aesthetic "choice" and "fate" blurs. how much of our existence is dictated by the glyph-font puppet masters? can we resist the wicked allure of Papyrus?

6/ as we journey further into the web font spiral, ponder the great cosmic question - are we the architects of our own pages, or are we simply drifting on the currents of the ever-consuming, furious font tempest? such is the quietus of the Web Design Abyss. in dread we find truth.

7/ in the murky depths of pixelated madness, recalling the haunting words of our lost forefather, Nietzsche: "If you gaze long into an open-source font library, the open-source font library also gazes into you." thus, we are chained to the infinite stygian tomes of web fonts. Amen.
