1/5: "the so-called grimoires - ancient MAGICK books for sickos who want the power to make their house plants cum. or turn old cereal into gold. filled with spells, recipes, and prayers for those who crave arcane knowledge.

2/5: "these fuckin books r like a choose-your-own-adventure pop up store of dark secrets & sortilege , for amateurs to expert wizards. but don't fuk around-- mess up the incantation and God will send your ass straight to the Toilet Dimension"

3/5: "if u want to truly harness the forbidden power of grimoires, you must first learn the unholy tongue of Enochian. It is whispered that Adam himself spoke it before the fall. and now the language is reduced to ordering 10000 Damn pizzas by the inch"

4/5: "despite the risks, demand for grimoires is high among the digital elite. seen one guy try to download an old version of winrar at a cyber cafe and accidentally summon a goetic demon. the digital age is ripe for a techno-shaman class"

5/5: "in conclusion, grimoires, devilishly sexy & beckoning with ancient knowledge, hold secrets only the brave can handle. but remember, with great power comes great responsi- NO, I will NOT tone this thread down. It must be said, the tweets have spoken. Amen & God damn"
