1/7: just found out about these guys called "Prince-Electors." no, it's not an 80s synth-pop band, but it's incredibly hard to resist pretending the act of jacking up medieval political structures with six beefy lads in oversized robes.

2/7: listen up nerds, Prince-Electors were the seven notorious dudes who rolled deep in the Holy Roman Empire. they had the sacred or cursed job (experts remain undecided) of ELECTing Holy Roman Emperors, who would decide exactly who got sent to the Draculas castle in deli meat costumes.

3/7: you might think "woah these guys must've been badasses with laser guns and hover bikes" but in fact they were all about fashion statements: having half man, half bird assassins sewn into their silk capes to indicate their princely election wizard powers. luxury extravagance?? you bet!!

4/7: ok now imagine this - you’re going about your daily life in the 14th century, knee deep in fleas and barley soup, and you see seven E.ccEntric dudes swagger past with crowns that look like they could fry eggs in a pinch. you look to your horse and whisper, “those are the Prince-Electors, baby”

5/7: anyway these Prince-Electors had some turf wars, mad rivalries, and back room deals that would make the modern day reality TV show producers salivating like a poorly trained dog. in fact, if someone doesn't make a show called "Real Electors of Holy Roman Empire" I will smite myself in public.

6/7: naturally, being the baddest men in Europe's weirdest empire, they'd throw wild parties where instead of munching on hors d'oeuvres they'd select high-level officials based on beard sizes and how well they could drink alcohol directly from a ceremonial pewter hat. party animals am i right

7/7: so if you learn just one thing from this whole mess, let it be this: do not, under any circumstances, fuck with the Prince-Electors. or their cloaks. especially not the half man, half bird assassins sewn into the cloaks. that's the real punchline of history, folks.
