1/ AH. the Fine film of Nasty Boys, known to the sophisticated as "Inglourious Basterds". gather round to bear Witness to my expertise on this TARANTO masterpiece. 

2/ let me begin,, with a simple question posed to the COMMUNAL brain: What if knife-guys from world War 2 decided to just Kill nazis as their Favourite Hobby? Taranto, clearly a scholar of History, has the answer.

3/ and then we have Christoph Waltz, a man of such Polite Evil; the world's most sinister host of Jeopardy. His unending thirst for Jew blood & milk makes the movie a thrilling Ride.

4/ wondreing how many Bastards there are? Im counting a WHOPPING eight inglourious basterds, plus Brad "Moneyball" Pitt as leader, barking orders & Scooping the scalps of Nazis as if they a're his BUFFEt.

5/ Ah FUCK. almost forget, there's a Cinema in this mess of a plot. A lady OWNS the CINEMA, her revenge plot is HOT n sticky like GOO, as she wishes to engulf the evil boys in a hellish inferno. Climactic!!

6/ I Believe it was the BIBLE, which said let he who is Inglourious Cast the First Basterdâ€”And so, their legacy lives on, as we continue to Kill Nazi sympathizers with our Powerful Insults

7/ in conclusion, Taranto's Inglourious Basterds is an enriching exploration into the lives of Knife Guys, Nasty Nazis, and Cinema Lovers. Remember, it is always important to remain #Inglourious in trying times. wint has spoken
