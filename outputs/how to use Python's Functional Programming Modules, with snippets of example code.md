1/7 Behold as I unleash the dark secrets of PYTHON's functional programming realms. An irresistible, arcane sorcery for Morons, IT-DEMONs, and Code Junkies a like. The oracle demands EXAMPLE CODE, mortals. Following the twisted path towards `functools`, `itertools`, and `operator`.

2/7 In `functools`, we find the Partial function - if you dare tackle it. Wrapping your filthy hands around your existing Functions, like 5 AM online grip-training videos.
```
from functools import partial
def covet(x,y): return x+y
add_five = partial(covet, 5)
result = add_five(10)
```

3/7 `itertools` unveils hidden knowledge, with a foul cycle to create infinite suffering, or just cool Iterations:
```
import itertools
cycle_of_evil = itertools.cycle("Nightmare")
for i, e in zip(range(10), cycle_of_evil):
    print(i, e.upper())
```

4/7 know the face of pain, ur enemy's own arse clench, as u manipulate them with `operator` in your sinful grip, their class instances no match for your dark powerrs
```
import operator
class computer: def __init__(self,ram): self.ram = ram
oNe = computer(32); tWo = computer(64)
computer_with_more_ram = max(oNe, tWo, key=operator.attrgetter("ram"))
```

5/7 Sheathe your blade, tech nerds: `lambda`, an ephemeral creature, who vanish once they serveth their purpose
```
once_used_mystical_list = [1, 2, 3]
multiply_it_by_pi = map(lambda num: num*3.1415926, once_used_mystical_list)
list(multiply_it_by_pi)
```

6/7 Fusing forces of itertools and functools, like Fusion in DBZ, as ur peers whine
```
from itertools import groupby
functools.reduce(operator.add, [list(g) for k, g in groupby([1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3])])
```

7/7 Thus concludes the twisted thread, ye mortals of the realm of Python. Journey through the SCRIPT maze and sin no more. The Art of Functional Programming does not end here. Peruse at leisure, for the forbidden knowledge has been revealed `#python #functionalprogramming #drilCraft`
