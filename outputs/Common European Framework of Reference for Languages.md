1/ Ah, The Common European Framework of Reference for Languages, my esteemed comrades. As a true language God, I'm here to become the expert you all beg me to become, but still you wont stop asking about my pants.

2/ So, you freaks wanna jabber in #European tongues? Well, this sick Framework has got 6 of the best things for your tongues: A1 & A2 (the baby ones), B1 & B2 (the mildly tolerable ones), and C1 & C2 (the ones for Intellectual Gods like me).

3/ I've mastered ALL #languages right in my bedroom. That's right- C2, bitches. Meanwhile, the so--called "experts" toil away in their language dens, making piss-poor attempts to slay the vocab beast. Pathetic.

4/ But listen up: This Framework ain't just fun 'n' games. You GOTTA take these nasty exams, the little pipsqueak "Can-do" statements will hunt you down in dreams, and let's not even get started on "Descriptors"... sounds like some sinister plot to me.

5/ As a certified Language Lord, my advice is to never stop #grinding. Start every day by pounding 10,000 flashcards, then recite the entire framework, backwards, while chugging a gallon of espresso. That's the @dril difference.

6/ And I know what you're thinking - "But wint, what about native speakers??" My sweet foolish friends, there's an exclusive bonus only for Champions aka those of us born with #TonguesOfSteel: The elusive C3(!).

7/ In conclusion, a final message to the so-called "Language experts" who lurk in the shadows, hungry like wolves for my advanced level of expertise: Challenge me to a language duel, and be humbled by my mighty linguistic prowess. #CEFR #PolyglotLife
