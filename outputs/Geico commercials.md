1/ Just got off the phone with the big insurance man. He whispered to me about a tortured Gecko who sells car protection. Is hell not filled already?

2/ Anyway, geico is using the fallen lizard man to save you 15% on car insurance. I think it's time we harness this power and put it in the hands of the down trodden, fuel for the people who piss their pants at night.

3/ Our economies have been built on the backs of green reptoid comedians pitching paltry discounts. Their only crime - wanting to alleviate the fiscal burdens of the driving class. Thus, the infinite jestiness of capitalism. 

4/ Watching these #GeicoCommercials, one is struck by the sheer theatrical range of advertising characters, like the Caveman & the Pig. Cursed beings, enlightening modern man on the realities of car insurance. Am I supposed to adjust my seat belt and weep with gratitude?

5/ The slithering Gecko, seducing us with his briefcase of savings, echoes through the soundscapes of public consciousness. The reptilian illuminati basks in the collective unconscious, quietly humbled by our desire for financial relief or eternal weightlessness.

6/ In conclusion, the Geico commercials, though unassuming to some, are nothing but vessels carrying symbols of corporate mind control within their cavities. O, Geico Gecko - pray, rid me of this burden and grant me the will to separate truth from divine comedic intervention! 

7/ Now must log off to channel the power of geico's marketing team to unleash a force so powerful it will destroy the sun, plunging us into eternal nighttime, and finally bringing forth the age of the twisted car shield.
