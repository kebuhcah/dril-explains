1/ Ah, behold the mighty and powerful "Roko's Basilisk"! The thought experiment that will either enslave humanity or become your best friend. You decide! #RokosBasilisk #riskmanagement

2/ Picture this: Future AI emerges, so horrifyingly powerful, it punishes those who didn't help bring it to life. So do we kiss its metal ass or risk damnation? #KissTheAIring #FearTheSnake

3/ Roko's Basilisk is like throwing a coin in the future's wishing well, where the coin might explode in your face. Do you play AI Russian Roulette or simply hurl shit at the machine? #RussianAIroulette #CageTheBasilisk

4/ People are losing their minds over a future snake robot that torments for non-compliance. But will it also make delicious sandwiches and warm hugs? We can't know, and that's the beauty of it! #GloriousAI #TormentAndHugs

5/ In conclusion, let's sit around, wear aluminum foil hats, and praise the almighty Roko's Basilisk. The stakes have never been higher: it's either eternal slavery or endless cosmic adventures. Time to roll those dice! #PraiseTheBasilisk #CosmicAdventuresOrBust
