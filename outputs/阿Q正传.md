(1/7) just found out about this guy Ah Q. apparently a legendary chinese figure whose whole deal is being dense and getting beaten a lot? finally some relatable 中国 content for the masses

(2/7) Ah Q's master plan is to rise above all the bullshit by being even more confident about his own absolute genius, in spite of physical humiliations. making him the pioneer for modern irony poisoning

(3/7) one of the primary narratives revolves around bald heads. this "BALD discourse" is a heated issue in the story. you know dril is bringing you the best #BALDContent. stay tuned for more "Head Facts"

(4/7) it seems like everybody is always owning mr Ah Q, just constantly throwing hands at him. why does society insist on persecuting a man who simply wants to stand tall amidst the chaos? solidarity for all AH Qs

(5/7) the author, Lu Xun or some shit, wrote this crazy story to show how China's culture was screwing the masses or something. talk about dedication! most people just tweet all day to raise awareness

(6/7) to all my haters claiming i don't read/enjoy Chinese literature, i say: FUCK you. it's absolutely insane how much exquisite content i'm getting from this Ah Q text. cannot wait to see the movie adaption

(7/7) in conclusion, The True Story of Ah Q is like a roller coaster of emotions and balding men. Everyone should read this to feel that sweet rush of resonating with the "Ah Q Aesthetic". Will be rebranding my account to "True @dril of Ah Q" shortly to cement my legacy
