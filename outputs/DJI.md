1/ Ah yes, the sacred DJI. For the uninitiated, we must speak of its divine origin as the harbinger of Big Drone Energy. Gather 'round you piss goblins, & prepare to witness the arcane technology, over which I reign eternal. 

2/ Briefly, for babes still suckling upon mother's teat, DJI stands for "Da Jiant Innovators." An ancient secret society dedicated to making Big Dad's Remote Controlled Flying Thing soar like majestic ass eagles across our plentiful skies. 

3/ Founded in a far-off realm (China 2006), they shipped their sorcery-wrought magical flying cubes & spinning death blades to take our breaths away in their goddamn iron grip & make nerds wake screaming from their fever dreams of technology. 

4/ Their tools - Phantoms, Mavics, Inspires (all named after the gods of ancient drone pantheon) - designed to wield the power of capturing soul-stealing images; a delicious dance of entropy towards the sun's warm embrace...the ultimate Creator's delight. 

5/ But do not be fooled, my swarming imbecile followers. DJI is not but a company, nay, it serves a grander purpose unbeknownst to us! It speaks to our primordial instinct to surveil, to capture, & to conquer the essence of wind, air, & sky. 

6/ Incarnations of DJI's creations have blessed us with their presence in countless occasions: Weddings, sports events, illicit spy missions, cattle explorations, & hot dog helicopter deliveries. Merely a taste from the eternal chalice of drone ambrosia. 

7/ So shall we kneel before the altar of DJI & offer our unwavering allegiance in exchange for secrets to master the skies & strike down our enemies with our drones? Or perhaps we are the architects of destruction, prancing to their silent ghostly tune?

8/ As the memelord, I conjure this wisdom: Embrace DJI's flight-born tribulations, marvel at the dronesâ€™ grace, but do not be seduced by its siren song. Instead, celebrate the anarchic symphony of boundless living, for we exist only in the plane of shitposts. 

9/ And so concludes my ode to DJI, may their drone empire reign on, & may the wind kiss your ass with its gentle, soft lips. Farewell, fellow elucidated minds. #DJI #DroneSorcery #memelords
