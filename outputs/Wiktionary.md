1/ just discovered a hidden gem called Wiktionary - the "Free dictionary" for those who dont want to waste their precious coins on definitions

2/ unlike the cowardly dictionaries that shamelessly hide their secrets for profit, wiktionary is brave and bold, fighting blind consumerism by arming the masses with free words of truth

3/ in a world where our minds are chained by paywalls and language is monopolized by the sinister elites, wiktionary stands like a gleaming beacon of justice, shining its rays of etymological freedom

4/ why pay for the sweet sweet nectar of knowledge when you can chug the unlimited source of wiktionary? The fools who patronize so called "Wolrd class dictioanries" shall bear witness to a new era of enlightenment

5/ never again will I furiously flip through a goddamned book of hell to decipher arcane jargon; instead, with the might of wiktionary, I shall speak like a true gentleman, requiring no page nor ink

6/ to those who doubt the power of wiktionary, i ask you: would you rather dwell as "brains in a vat" like the plebians, or join us atop of the ivory tower, gripping the limitless, open-source key to wordly mastery?

7/ to the old guard of language, locked away in their moldering palaces, fearing the power of wiktionary's digital dissemination: may it claw from the shadows to knock down your doors & spill forth its tongue of infinite tongues

8/ i, dril, protector of the net, declare my unwavering support for wiktionary & invite all noble souls to frolick in this digital garden, where lexicon & dialect bloom in uncontrained abandon, swirling free like the winds of fate
