1/ Ah, the Hanseatic League - Medieval Times' very own social network for trading, gossiping & bonding over smashing huge barrels of fish. A veritable "Who's Who" in the world of maritime business, where Guild Towns were the hot spots & Pirates were the deadbeats. #FishBrokerMojis

2/ Imagine - in the year 1400 something, getting dressed in your cumbersome fashions & setting sail for the bustling ports of Rostock, knowing that all your favorite fish-loving pals await you there like some sort of fish-barons' conference. A literal fish market, but fancier.

3/ The Hanseatic boys and girls were all about the grand idea of maritime feudalism - where everyone's free to trade as many herrings as their heart desires, no customs, no taxes, just you, the open ocean & a huge stash of salted fish in the hull. #HanseaticOceanCapitalism

4/ Forget about trade wars, government regulations, or nasty tariffs - The Hanseatic League's tagline should've been: "We've got fish, we've got goods, and by god, we will trade them as we please!" Best believe that no meddling king was getting between these freaks & their trade.

5/ There's just something magical about the idea of nations coming together solely to sell fish & say "Yeah, let's leave all the land-locked countryside geeks out in the cold while we party on the docks with our marine riches." Bold & Brave. Oceans 4 ever. #SeafaringFishCult

6/ In the end, as it goes, all fish parties have to come to an end. The fishlines broke, the power shifted, & the world of fish moguls faded. But let the memory of the Hanseatic League live on - a shining beacon of maritime trade that dared to dream of endless fish-futures. #RIP
