1/ just got word of this new super-villain running amok called "Chuck E. Cheese". absolute menace to society. will investigate further. #ProtectOurYouth

2/ infiltrating the rat man's lair, i am assaulted by sensory overload. flashy lights, screaming children, pizza pieces shouting my transgressions. does Mr. Cheese mock me with this theater of pain? #InvestigationContinues

3/ cannot shake the feeling that the animatronics on stage know something I don't. their janky movements and desperate songs taunt me as they gnash their metallic teeth. is this some kind of blood pact with Chuck E.? #RobotsNeedJesusToo

4/ in this jungle of chaos I find reprieve - the "Skee-ball" sanctuary. while the children flail in undisciplined frustration, my honed gamer instincts secure me untold tickets. my currency against the spiraling madness. #DrilBallChamp

5/ approaching the arbitrary economy of Chuck's den, they tell me there's a prize behind the glass. i gaze upon the paltry wares, hundreds of tickets spilling through my fingers like the sands of time. no prize for the weary. #TheJokesOnUs

6/ a persistent thought lingers as I stumble from Cheese's carnival of horror - this place is packed to the gills, on a weekday no less. it would seem that the rat man has claimed new victims today, myself included. #PrayForOurSins

7/ until our paths cross again, Chucky, I resign my query. my soul tainted, my pockets empty of tokens, only one certainty remains - today, the cheese has most certainly won. #GameOver
