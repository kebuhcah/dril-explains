1/6 ah yes, the illusive Somaliland. not quite as one would expect- its an international enigma, a place hovering in limbo, a secret club..a cocktail mixed with lemon, freedom and confusion. buckle in, my unwashed followers

2/6 first hand fact- somaliland isnt real somalia, it's "better somalia" - over 10 million people drink the cool aid- shhh don't upset the sensitive UN or they'll choke up & cry, refusing to acknowledge these champs

3/6 econy experts call it a "de facto sovereign state" w/ working gvt, coming a long way from it's dark days, now thriving like the potent yeast hidden in the pantry. but fake news herd & shout "ug recognition is a lie!"

4/6 somalilanders? theyre tough - like a spoiled bag of bacon crisps. determined to stand firm against pirates, extremists n crybaby haters. holding onto their DIY government faster than i grip my 6th soda can of the day

5/6 30 yrs of stability, growth- they're like a phoenix rising frm ashes of civil war. seems 2 me, peers and princes alike shuld rcgnize these folks with the bravery of soldiers & the unwavering confidence of men pissing in the park

6/6 one things certain- @dril will continue to learn and grow so as to confound and inspire my greasy admirers. Somaliland- my offer stands, hire me as a "mntor" to usher in a new golden age of verified blue check tweets n smug grins #SomalilandSovereigntySquad
