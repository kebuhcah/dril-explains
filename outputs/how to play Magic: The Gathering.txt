1/ Ah, so the masses clamor for my impeccable wisdom on "Magic: The Gathering" - a card game for so-called intellectual types. What a foolish endeavor; but who am I to deny such masochistic pursuits? Prepare for #DrilMagic101. 

2/ First, we acquire the essentials: cards, enemy (to crush), snacks (for strategic sustenance in time of need). Empty your wallet unto the nearest comic dungeon, and purchase packets of the glistening cardboard idols. 

3/ Each player demands a 'deck'. Construct it with soldiers, dragons, and sorcery. There are 'Lands' or territories - grasp the honor of ruling vast estates, evicting piss Elves from their wooded hovels. Show no remorse.

4/ Next, each player must summon tremendous life force, represented as '20 life points'. No relation to health insurance deductibles or pyramid scheme commissions. 

5/ Begin the eternal battle. Players take turns to cast spells and summon minions - making the leap from the cozy unknown realm to annihilate your opponent's life points, breaking them mentally and emotionally.

6/ Piss feeble players may 'tap' or twist their lands into a grotesque angle as a gesture of submission. Your opponent will shiver with fear as you crank the cards 90 degrees, heralding an onslaught of raw celestial havoc. 

7/ If your Magic prowess is as potent and lethal as mine, your victory is inevitable. Your opponent will concede in agony as their card towers crumble, their life force whimpering and obliterated.

8/ Always remember, final power resides neither in the hands of the player nor the so-called card Gods. The true master of this devilish game is the miserable deity known as RNG (Random Number Goddess). Beware.

9/ Embrace the subsequent social immortality as you ascend amidst the legends of Magic: The Gathering. Although you may remain seated, your spirit dances on the impermeable surface of infinite victory.

10/ And so concludes #DrilMagic101. Now, go forth and obliterate those who dare to challenge your cards in the sacred battleground. Strip them of their smattering dignity, feast on their salty tears. Good luck & god speed.
