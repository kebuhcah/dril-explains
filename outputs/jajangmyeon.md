1/15- "ja-jang-myeon"..not a dungeon escape scenario or Scorsese film. its the noodly dish from the god damn far east realms. i suck up the Dark Sauce on a moonless night. #JajangmyeonOfficial

2/15- unleashing the throbbing power of dark soy bean paste. it whispers blackened secrets into the damn hearts of the noodles. gastronomic pleasure? or soul-destroying showdown?

3/15- wolves howl in the distance as i summon the heroic contents of Jajangmyeon. no sesame oil to smoothen my path. serving size? unlimited. the cyber-bullies cower in nail-biting terror

4/15- knead the dough into a perfect canvas. resist the urge to sign my name on such powerful art. the noodle renders all signature irrelevant. ascension achieved. water meets flame. i puff chest

5/15- frying chunjang breaks the silence. fumes of desire collide in the harsh realm of kitchen air. no mortal may resist the sweet sweet stench of potato and onion yowling for attention

6/15- in the void of a cosmic night, a pot of boiling water and noodles creates its own #Gravity. reality becomes spaghetti, twisted and tender as justice. nothing else matters but noodle

7/15- strings of darkness intertwine with culinary fate. drizzled love or distilled hate? do the congealed tendrils of Jajangmyeon entangle our destiny mere seconds before devouring?

8/15- critics say theres a knock off called "ZhaJiangMian". i spit in the faces of those who slander my beloved noodle domain. muttering under my breath "psalms 23:04" as i slurp mercilessly

9/15- balance is restored in the communion of noodle and sauce. like two star-crossed lovers merging into a singularity of flavor explosion. rendering the matrix of taste, obsolete

10/15- jajangmyeon is not just food. its philosophy. the survival of the fittest. one may become untethered in the steamy embrace of wheat and sauce. my master warned me of this, and I #Icarus

11/15- i consume these dark tendrils of anti-nutrition like they were crafted by the sins of man. they bend and curve to my whim, conform to my will, and fulfill the prophecy. #noodlepower

12/15- gorging on this ebony pasta made me realize. jajang is the heart, the mind, the soul. noodle is the canvas, a dream of infinity. together they form an immortal bond, stronger than law

13/15- jajangmyeon is not a choice. it is a way of life thrust upon us by the cosmic strings that yank us from slumber. one bite..it transcends time and space, it feeds the damned and the holy

14/15- beware the bowls that do not tremble before my clashing chopsticks. for the power I hold, hums within my blood, my spirit fills with ancient vigor. I return to life once more as the noodle-slurper

15/15- in the end, jajangmyeon isn't just some shitty meal to chomp down & casually discard. no. it's an experience that cleaves the flesh and tears the damn soul, marking you forever. call me #JajangmyeonOracle
