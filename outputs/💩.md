1/ alright everybody gather around, it's time to talk about the real deal here -- the unsung hero of our lives, the mysterious artifact we all know & love: ðŸ’©

2/ now some of you might say "wint, why should I care about this nasty substance?" but thats the thing- we live in a society where the humble deuce has been stigmatized, but its actually a core part of our pathetic existence.

3/ fact: we all ðŸ’©, some more than others. ive dedicated years of research to this profound phenomenon. made diagrams, wrote a 600-page thesis on "elimination geometry" - i'm eminently qualified to discuss this deeply misunderstood topic.

4/ the aesthetic beauty of the perfect turd cannot be understated. it's like admiring the curves of a fine sports car or the delicate contours of a beautiful piece of pottery... crafted by the skilled muscular hands of the human bowel.

5/ ðŸ’© is the ultimate equalizer. it doesnt discriminate between rich or poor, powerful or weak. even the coolest, most influential people in the world are still dropping precious waste nuggets behind closed doors - this is the thread that binds humanity together.

6/ next time you're sitting on the porcelain throne, take a moment to appreciate the silent artistry of this all too frequent act. it's humbling, really. the brief moment where our hubris is dismantled and we see the essence of our fragile human condition.

7/ so let's raise a steaming mug to the true hero amongst us: ðŸ’©. may we all find solace in the primal, communal act of transcending bodily restraints through this humble, universal display of life's constants. God bless.
