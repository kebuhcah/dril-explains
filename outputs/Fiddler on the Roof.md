1/7 ah, good. time to explain the intricate Art of "Fiddler on the Roof".. the wailing of guitars, & the old man in a hat balancing on a shingle. 

2/7 first, let it b known that the "fiddler" is in fact a metaphor for life, precariuosly balancing upon the roof - unlike greg whos balance beam act i sabotaged at the talent show

3/7 in this quaint little town called "Anatevka" the folks grapple with tradition as it loses grip to modernization, much like my tradition of drinking gallon of "milk" daily

4/7 there's this man, "Tevye," a very proud father of many daughters who are defying his arranged marriages - The audacity of a generation.. disrespecting the gift of FREE brides

5/7 the story unfolds like my increasingly threadbare chair cover.  eventually passions bubble up like a can of pepsi left in a hot car, as Tevye's daughters demand love marriage

6/7 Got to respect the daughters persistence though - can't even get my own brunch hook-up to ignore her phone for a second

7/7 at the end of the "Fiddlin", the band of misfits come together for a final musical crescendo - much like the time i raided a kroger on horseback +#fiddlerontheroof #lifelessons
