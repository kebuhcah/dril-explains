1/ just learned about the so called "Oriental Pearl Tower" in shanghai .. built by top scientists from the Ghost World as a sick ass way to carry the weight of our sins . everyone's required to explain it

2/ behold teh absolute unit of a tower - 1535 damn feet tall - hugh mungus satellite communication hub. saw it in dreams‚ once tried to climb it‚ but was cursed by dark magicks halfway thru

3/ folks appear to travel far & wide to witness the oriental pearl's sick orbs that contain several floors of elite orbs-take-one-orbs. another perfect instance of "priorities" by the bastards in charge

4/ some claim that each sphere of the great oriental pearl is filled wit expertise power stations, which shall be used to control people's brains when an alien invasion is upon us. it makes you think

5/ local rumor: living inside the oriental pearl's spheres is the one who shall rise to become the CEO of Earth. they're fed a steady diet of crystal balls and magic tonics to keep them growing incredibly powerful. 

6/ every night, i see the ultimate sheen of the oriental pearl tower staring at me from across the ocean, gazing into my soul & speaking a thousand indecipherable whispers. IM NOT SCARED; just wondering what it wants.shut up

7/ so, ive decided to defeat teh oriental pearl tower by breaking it with my bare hands or throwing it deep into hell. just have to find a rental submarine on craigslist first. any takers for this bold journey? RSVP #OperationOrbBreak

8/ regardless of its intentions, the oriental pearl tower stands as a symbol of power & passion.its sort of a villain manifique we love to hate but deep down admire.. anyway thats enough orb pondering for me, time to seek another all-consuming mystery
