1/10 Just got word from my sources: "Byzantine Emperors" are back on the menu! presenting the world with history's TOP Champs of Byzantines.

2/10 Old "Justinian I" kickin it with his "Code" of laws. Like going online to codeschool, except in real life. And they didnt even have iPads

3/10 "Heraclius" - revampin the whole bizantine management. Disrupting the Roman tradition like your first cousin who dropped out of dental school to hawk baseball cards on eBay.

4/10 "Basil I" - strangled a stepson, and I can't prove it. Regardless, he got the job done. founding the Macedonian Dynasty. Im goin to pitch an idea called President by Ass-Kicking.

5/10 Theophilus: If you like getting kicked out of Church, this guys got you covered. hater of Icons. ruthless Iconoclast. did I mention his BIG HAT?

6/10 Michael III: don't go calling your buddy "your wine barrel" like Bardas, he will unsheathe the dagger of Blindness. Blind by excitement of his overlordship, am i right?

7/10 Nikephoros II Phokas - the "pale death of the saracens." can't look cool & carry a name like that without a wicked skill set. sword fighting demigod reign supreme.

8/10 Alexios I Komnenos - Bringing it ALL back: the gold, silver, the land, and the authority. Daddy of the Komnenian Restoration. Praise be the Savior Lord Komnenos.

9/10 Basil II - He wasn't playing with the "Bulgar Slayer" nickname. Boy could rack up a high score eradicating rebels like a nuisance. u Jel?

10/10 Constantine XI Palaiologos - The last hoorah! defending Constantinople like its his backyard BBQ pit. vaporized in battle; true style!+10 respect!!

Thats the list, boys - ten blazing thrones of zealous majesty. Got your Byzantine fix? let me hear ya!! And as always, follow @dril for more extremely real knowledge bombs.
