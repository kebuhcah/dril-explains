1/7 - a lot of pinheads on this wicked site are jibber-jabbering about "color revolutions" like its some sort of weird crayon melee. time to set the record straight. buckle up, imbeciles. #ColorMeDril

2/7 - firstly, don't get it twisted. "Color Revolutions" ain't about color toner cartridge wars. it's actually Machiavellian Political intrigue wrapped in embarrassing hues & god awful palettes. Mona Lisa laughing her ass off. #CrayolaConspiracy

3/7 - ok dumbasses now listen CLOSE. its the name given to protest movemnts that happen in countries who are tired of their dumb ass governments. and yes they choose colors to rally round..like " Orange "" Rasberry "" "Marmalade"" shades ... even mustard is fair game. #colorcodedcoup

4/7 - now, let's talk about people who fancy themselves Lord High Monarchs of these so called "color revolutions". men in powerful people suits, sending fake love letters to the common man. hands stained with printer ink, can't see beyond their glossy shades. #PhantomInk

5/7 - critics of these so called "color revolutions" go on about outside influence + clandestine interfer's. While their heads are spinning, the masterminds crack open a cold one & enjoy the world's most twisted paint by numbers. #ShadyColorPalette

6/7 - in conclusion, these "color revolutions" ain't your grandma's paint by numbers y'all. it's the world stage show for twisted multi-colored crooked schemes. politics really need to tone it down a notch, no one's impressed. #ColoredNonsense

7/7 - so as u can see, "Color Revolutions" are serious business. whether u wanna join team "bomtato marigold" or "tangerine turquoise"â€“ be warned, the game isn't over until the last LED printer stops its crooked hum. thank u for joining me on this majestic jouney, u may now applaud.
