1/ the souls of the dead are whispering to me that "Dark" is a TV series on "NetFlix" where time plays the damn fiddle, like a twisted rubix cube of genealogy. sucks ass. terrible. 9 seasons watched. 

2/ i am forced to witness life become a cosmic web, hypnotized into reading flow charts like a god damn telecommuter. people asking me what the fuck is happening. i tell them im @dril, not   tutoring grandmas in time travel buffet. #DarkNetflix

3/ imagine how many sweaty dollars Netflix spent to create this forest of mind-fuckery... smearing my thoughts against their dumpster fire of paradoxes. they laugh as I squirm. joke's on them, im taking their subscription money and buying corndogs at 3am.

4/ The incessant chanting of "Jonas" drills a hole through my subconscious, as I float amidst the vortex of light and darkness. Nietzsche's ghost whispering "tight pants Mickey Mouse" in my ear. we're all trapped in the eternal suffering of Dark baby.

5/ In conclusion, Dark is a show where even your grandpa, your cousin, and your sister's best friend's boyfriend could be the same damn person. it makes me want to drink bleach with a straw. But who keeps watching? me. wint prevails. #DarkNetflix #TimeIsTheEnemy
