Tweet 1: absolutely losing my shit over here trying to decode the mysteries of kosovo. its a country it's a conflict it's a fucken enigma wrapped in hormones dipped in redbull. #kosovoRocks #help_meUnderstand

Tweet 2: just found out kosovo declared indpeendence in 2008. can you imagine living in a place so new?? my fridge is fucking older than the country, and it's full of hot dogs. what does it all mean?? #newBornBabyNation #freshOutOfTheSiege 

Tweet 3: NATO intervening in kosovo is like when your friend buys you a turkish oil wrestling event to make up for eating your leftover pizza. thank you for your input but i'm wearing body armor now asshole. #dontTouchMyPizza #90sWar

Tweet 4: UN resolution 1244?? more like confusion 12,404. damn world, can we just save our drama for reality television and let kosovo live?? #GettingTangledInPolitics #ResolutionOrNah

Tweet 5: serbia's out here like an angry ex coming to embrace kosovo in a passive-aggressive hug choking them softly, whispering "you'll never be truly independent" in their ear. chill, serbia. #badBreakUp #romcomGoneWrong

Tweet 6: i got 99 problems and #kosovosIndependence is one. shoutout to the albanians and serbs for creating a hot mixtape called "War Crimes anthology" which i will never listen to. #historical_gangsta

Tweet 7: in the end, i have learned one thing about kosovo: who among us does not desire the sweet embrace of sovereignty. we are all kosovars in our souls, yearning to be free from the tyranny of hot dog-powered nations. godspeed. #deepEmoThoughts #kosovoBound
