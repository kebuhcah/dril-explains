1/7 ah, yes folks. the "Joker" movie. a film where our good buddy Joker runs amok in a city full of unlicensed clowns. it's chaos i tell you. chaos!!

2/7 sometimes life just so cruel, shit becomes poo, and you become ClownMan. That's the big secret crunched into 2 hours of "cinematic" "masterpiece" 

3/7 Oh the Joker dances on stairs, becomes menace to society... as we all know, stairs provide very convenient platforms for such sinister behavior

4/7 to all those who hath watched "The Joker" (2019) and worried, do not fear. I tried becoming " society's enemy " and ended up getting charged $120 for trespassing at the local circus. It ain't worth it 

5/7 Critics say it's too "violent" or "controversial"... well, let me tell you i've seen gorier scenes in a children's teeter-totter, unfolding itself in real time

6/7 would the true Joker really tweet about his own movie? no because he's too busy plotting social experiments on this god forsaken planet! All of you imposters stand down, and put the Joker makeup down.

7/7 in conclusion, we've all made some laughs, faced some frowns, perhaps pondered our dance moves or our relationships with fridges.  but, the real Joker is within us all.. just don't let him slip on a banana peel or get hit by a cream pie.
