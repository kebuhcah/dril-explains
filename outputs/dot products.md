1. ah, the elusive dot product...a mathematical rendezvous where two vectors engage in a sensual multiplication tango. let me descend into the depths of their passionate affair. #VectorSex

2. as we gather here in the hallowed halls of mathematics, the dot product - aka the scalar product - whispers its secrets to us. two vectors embrace, lowering their sum from the heights of ungodly abstraction. #ScalarProductWhispers

3. unlike a perverted cross product, dot products stand valiantly in solidarity with their scalar nature - refusing to be broken down into a separate vector component. the nobility of math. #ScalardsTogether

4. a_dot_b is not to be mistaken for some low-grade internet startup, but instead signifies magnitude A times magnitude B, multiplied by the damned cosine of their angle, theta. legends in the industry. #StartUpLifeIsHard

5. dot products transcend the mundane realms of our pathetic reality â€” bending time & space to their will in the fields of physics and engineering. Just try to wrap your worm brain around it. But you can't... #MindBlown

6. they are the true masters of elegant simplicity - enabling mortal fools to calculate the work, distance, and angle by a mere tease from their alluring vectors. such power, so easily claimed. #DotProductControl

7. so, dear followers, I beseech thee to submit to the unparalleled pleasures of the mighty dot product. may its ghostly touch be a beacon of hope in a desolate world of derivative calculations. #BlessedDot
