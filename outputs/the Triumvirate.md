1/8 Triumvirate.. the Ancient Rome's elite crew, pooling their wisdom to run the show like professional gamers, dipping their toes in politics, power, and sweet sweet togas. 

2/8 The first Big Boy alliance - Julius Caesar, Pompey, Crassus - uniting their undeniable energies. togas flappin, asses clappin, Rome has never seen such an ungodly combination of raw talent.

3/8 Caesar bringing his horse whispering skills and charm to the table. while Pompey and Crassus, in a stunning display of bromance, control the senate with an iron fist & sturdy sandals. 

4/8 I refuse to apologize for my belief that ALL TRIUMVIRATE MEMBERS should be FIGHTING LIONS & eating grapes off marble plates. you can't run Rome without fear, and frankly, an appetite for grapes.

5/8 then we got Triumvirate 2: Electric Boogaloo - Mark Antony, Octavian, & Lepidus. their unwritten motto: "we're like a cool club but with swords" - these 3 knew how to capitalize on previous hit & made it chartbuster.

6/8 the thing about power is it breeds rivalry like a rat king of testosterone, pride and hubris. So, eventually, pals become enemies, fights get personal, and Caesar, my man, gets stabbed 23 times. RIP to a legend.

7/8 Pro-Triumvirate-tips: 1) don't marry frenemy's daughter (Mark vs Octavius) 2) do NOT get caught between said frenemies 3) LEARN FROM THE FIRST TRIUMVIRATE

8/8 this concludes my examination of the TRIUMVIRATE. to all those who have been inspired by these lads, strap on your finest sandals and learn the electric slide, for the Empire awaits. it's time to (Rome)antically dance in their honor.
