1/6 ah, the legendary "charle Magne". great big king of the olden days, who conquered vast quantities of 'europe'. Absolute Magnitude of a man. graced by god his very self or something. #HistoryBuff

2/6 somehow, the big charle managed to unite a bunch of fragmented tribes with his huge aura alone. just imagine the magnetism required in his cranial pores to maintain it. powerful #BossMoves

3/6 some claim this charleman was the "Father of Europe"?? Absolutely most epic Dad Zone. zero embarrassments; only ruthless diplomacy and big chungus energy. entire families bow-down. #DaddyWasHere

4/6 despite his crushing busy schedule filled with wars and conquering, our man charle found time to promote education, establish courts, and instill a code of law in his personal fief-y kingdom. a true #ScholarAndGentleman 

5/6 what impresses me the most is how Charlemagne was crowned "Holy Roman Emperor". called the pope to his castle, wearing god tier regalia and said "guess what? i'm in charge now". absolute madlad maneuver.

6/6 so next time you see a map of Europe and wonder "who the fuck created this mess?", just remember "charle Magnitude" and his relentless quest for fatherhood, glory and vitamin-rich foods. history never tasted so good. #CharlemagneTheGreat
