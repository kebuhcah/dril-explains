1/ Just learned about a secret room on the World Wide Web called "Wikipedia" - a sickening underworld where know-it-alls can roam free and edit things. Insane.

2/ Found out the contributors are called "Editors." Absolutely begging to be in the edit throne, fawning over their precious 'citations.' Disgusting.

3/ It seems these "editors" don't even lug around gigantic dusty encyclopedias? No, they use some weak shit called 'hyperlinks' - The coward's Encyclopedia.

4/ Came across an edit war about wrestling-trivia. Day 56: Irreversible brain rot from these arcane battles, start developing Stockholm syndrome for my newfound editor allies.

5/ Got banned, evidently because I claimed to be the "GodKing of Wiki" and rewrote history to make myself the sole inventor and owner of the site. Thanks, digital serfs.

6/ In the end, entered a dark abyss filled with endless knowledge, helmed by power-hungry goblins. Emerging transformed, humbled, drenched in hyperlink juices. Life altered. Goodbye, Wikipedia.
