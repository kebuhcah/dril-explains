1/15 I'm gonna tackle two-point convertions or as i like to call it: "the double banger","the double dog dare you" of football. Strapon your ass, folks, because the vast ocean of knowledge is about to be uncorked

2/15 We all know a touchdown in football. But did you know that we have something called EXTRA-POINT that you get after touchdown? these sickos??? But what if I told you there is something beyond that? Buckle up

3/15 The Two-Point Conversion is a magical beast that feeds off the screams of the opposing team's fans. It's like the Regular Extra Point except you gotta put those footballs back through the wooden-gates instead of kicking them into the oblivion

4/15 Give unto my infant brain that of the pleasure of a powerful two-point conversion. A finer feeling than life i have yet to uncover. I shall humbly consume the many pellets provided by such a bestowment.

5/15 You score your touchdown, just an ordinary afternoon of scoring points- right? WRONG. Enter the Two-Point Conv. Your team doesn't just want the 6, they want it ALL-They want that 8.

6/15 back in the dark old times when i played "football" when you scored the Two-Point Conversion a team of muppet style oldmen would come out, gory and beaten, and they would demand you pay them large sums of cash

7/15 Like a caterpillar transforming in2 a butterfly, the two-point play births the team with its divine flame of evolution. Play 2 Win??? More like Two-Point Win!!!

8/15 there is a hierarchy of fools, all dying for the validation of a classy Two-point Conversion:1 The yard invader 2 The ball hailer 3 The lewd coach. Must get my hands on these precious points

9/15 i have dreamt of a world where every football point shits life upon another football, like a daisy chain of infant larva that sprouts into a fabulous two-point god head

10/15 The Two-Point Conversion is more than an exploit of our carnivorous desire to conquer- it is a portal into the astral plane where we transcend our forms, becoming one with the nebulous void surrounding

11/15 When you witness the miracle of the Two-Point Conversion; let your primal screams accumulate into a collective call to arms 4 the original Dance of Goat, as primeval as the Greeks, magnificent as the stars themselves

12/15 I called up the NFL and screamed "MAKE EVERY PLAY A TWO-POINT CONVERSION!" they hung up, deafened by my passionate demands, weeping as their new reality began to take shape

13/15 In this realm, football now operates on the plane of true demigods, mortal men tearing through the fabric of existence and shape of possibility itself, in the quest for 2 delicious points at a time

14/15 Football no longer has its limits. The Two-Point Conversion instigates what can only be defined as a crucial awakening in the realm of sport; and thus, of the stars themselves. Awake!!

15/15 And as we plunge further down the spine of the beast known as the Two-Point Conversion, let us be engulfed within its structural majesty, we are but humble atoms rearranging . End
