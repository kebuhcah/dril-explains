1/ Ah, Weimar Berlin, the golden era of piss parties, incomprehensible art and a currency so fucked its sole purpose was to make toilet paper seem like gold bullion. let me elucidate the mystique

2/ walking the streets of Weimar Berlin chanting "Please sir, more inflation" as i trade my life savings for one shitty and depressing theatre ticket. that's the high life folks

3/ They said, "wow, the Treaty of Versailles, what could go wrong?" well, i have news for you, chief. it's high time for disastrous economic policies to fuel my wig collection. cue Weimar Berlin stage left

4/ they call me the sexual degenerate of Weimar-era Berlin. not because I partake in Hedonistic pursuits, oh no. simply because I refuse to wear shoes and loudly scream at currency exchange windows

5/ who needs a functional economy when your main export is abstract Theatre? some guy in a top hat throwing paint at the wall saying it's a representation of " the Duality of suffering and pleasure in a Society." give me a break

6/ obsessed with overnight millionaires made from the hyperinflation of Weimar-era berlin, Truly dedicated to the art of waking up one day and purchasing every chair on earth, just to fuck with the masses

7/ Out here trying to recreate the majesty of Weimar-era Berlin by trading my 401k for one single beautiful balloon. I will ascend like a king amidst economic collapse

8/ Weimar Berlin, the tale of how an entire nation just said, "fuck it let's be cool and nuts," turned into a remarkable loop of art, sex, and cash burning insanity. History is a hell of a drug, friends.
