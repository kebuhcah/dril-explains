1/ alright jackasses, buckle up because im about to Guide your moron asses through the secret art of dominating the "middle" ages if, hypothetically, you get sucked into some dumb ass portal

2/ first of all do NOT trust any so-called "Wizards" you encounter. every medieval magician is just a smelly dude covered in squirrel shit doing basic card tricks. they will absolutely steal from you, given the chance

3/ invest in a strong yet elegant sword, like a Single True Gentleman. own that blade & make it an extension of your god damn hand. NOTE: donot show your sword off too much, or clowns will challenge you to a duel & you'll get killed due to their erratic movements

4/ don't talk too much about the future, like cars or space flights. these buffoons will think you're possessed and throw you in jail. instead get popular by making bold claims like "I know when the crops will grow" and blame a bad harvest on wrong readings of the stars or some shit

5/ extremely important: DO NOT mention hygiene or dental care. these archaic jokers will just spit at you & call you a nerd. if you need to brush your teeth. just slip away, do it discreetly, and rejoin the shit goblins, pretending your teeth ache from lack of brushing

6/ forget the horse. tame a Massive Tick and ride on that. they will fear and respect you. Trust me it will pay dividends. King will invite you to his Guild and you can give him advices like "could u stop taking baths in Peasant Blood please"

7/ finally, attempt to invent a time machine using only stone hammers, animal bladders & clay tablets. to get the fuck back into the future. the absolute minute you find yourself in medieval toilet. if its in the making, tweet about "being the first time traveler". legendary move.
