1/ Ah, the noble Floppy Disk - an ancient relic, shrouded in mystery, thrusting data at the cruel hands of obsoleteness. Tell me, dear "Tech Wizards" of the world…do you dare reckon with the power of the magnetic square?

2/ I gaze upon the 3.5" plastic square and confess my unwavering devotion. A storage capacity of 1.44MB, barely able to contain a single jpeg of my custom "Beverage Rig" – yet, it's enough to induce pure euphoria in the hearts of true Computer Lords.

3/ And who among you, "Digital Natives," has witnessed the mesmerizing ritual of inserting the floppy? The gentle slide, a soft click as the child returns to the mother. It is not simply data exchange, but a sacred dance between ethereal beings.

4/ Dare not forget the Greatest Sin: exploiting the Floppy's vestibule for foul schemes known as "shareware." Weep for the countless disks ensnared in this web of deceit, evoking the wrath of the irate Computer Lords. YOU WERE DESIGNED FOR GREATER THINGS, MY CHILD.

5/ Imagine, if you will, a universe where cloud storage lies on a distant horizon. A place where secrets, dreams, & forbidden knowledge nestle within the Floppy’s bosom. A haven for the “RAW COMPUTE” aesthetic, brimming with untamed potential.

6/ Yes, I, the wretched fiend of the Internet, weep at the demise of the Floppy Disk. A tragic loss, like a phoenix that refuses to rise from the ashes. Etch its memory within your souls, lest you become Hollow Husks with brains full of USB sticks & terabytes of emptiness.

7/ In conclusion, embrace the eternal wisdom of the Floppy Disk & you shall achieve mastery over your digital domain. Let us not mourn its passing, but celebrate the treasured memories it has given us. Say it with me: LONG LIVE THE FLOPPY DISK. LONG LIVE DATA.
