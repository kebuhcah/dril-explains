1/ ah, yes. the almighty Slack. the Digital Boardroom where We, the CEOs of the Internet, lie prostrate in our own filth, groveling like worms to beg forgiveness from our peers for reading their messages.

2/ logging into Slack. communing with my 6000 colleagues, all of whom are named "Derek" or "brad," and it's futile to differentiate them. thrusting our Voices into the merciless void that is The Channel; begging The Apps to nourish our pitiful ambition.

3/ rest assured, the slack experience wouldnt be complete without enterign a "Private chat room " where we pitch our pitiful ideas n get instantly annihilated by thousdands of throbbng Animated Gifs... the eternal cycle of relentless Psychic Damage.

4/ resisting the siren call of Slack Emojis, lest i be dragged into the abyss of endless inane communication... scrolling through a mire of "thumbs up" and "party_parrot"... losing days of my life... i fear the Slackification of my very essence.

5/ and yet, we cannot avoid the dreaded "Response Deadline"; chains forged in the heart of the Slack. tethered to an ephemeral concept of Desperation, our minds erode under the ceaseless pressure to Produce, Create, and Collaborate.

6/ so this is the slack. the modern tech dungeon, feeding off the spirits of The Workers; slowly coaxing us to our emotional doom. a ghastly chimera bred to suffocate us under a tidal wave of progress n giggles. but fate demands we walk straight into the jaws of madness.

7/ the shacklemaster calls, i must return to my Slack Chamber posthaste & let the notifications slowly swallow me whole. goodnite sweet user, may the Gods of Asynchronus Messaging grant you solace amidst the chaos of Digital Team Bonding.
