1/ Time to put on the thinking pants and dive into the enigmatic world of STROMAE, the uncontrollable force behind those foot-thumping beats that have colonized our brain folds. #StromaeAnarchy

2/ stRomAe enters the "belgian house" of music, hands full of "rapped words" like a chaotic flavor chef, and now everyone's addicted to his secret sauce. mother of god, he's cracked the code. #MayonnaiseMaestro

3/ imagine synthesizing the raw power of Dracula with electronic wizards Kraftwerk, blasting that unholy union into space, then hearing the sickly cries of the captivating stromae as he gazes upon humanity from high atop. #DarkSpaceKing

4/ stromae's like a modern tesla coil spewing out electricity that forms thic, delicious beats, shocking your system til u embrace his chaotic rhythm. you can't escape the music, as our bones become instruments. #TheDanceWillClaimUsAll

5/ existing within the precarious paradox that is papaoutai, stromae pulls no punches, revealing both the modern father's struggle and pop culture's obsession with melody. thrillingly brutal. #DadCore

6/ If Edison was a music genius without the scandals and stealing, stromae would be the result. his music is both bold and heinous, shaking us awake like a goth phoenix risen from a club's worth of ashes. #ManiacMelodist

7/ It's said that Stro-Mae is an anagram of 'Maestro,' but perhaps we should call him the puppeteer of hearts, as he drags us around the emotional playground of his hallowed discography. #AmongTheStrings

8/ And in the end, what is Stromae but a reflection of society? a dazzling prism through which we can clearly see ourselves? flawed, complex and undeniably swayable. #StromaeHumanMirror

9/ Whether you cower at the sound of his hypnotic baritones or rise to embrace the frantic whirlwind of his soul-deep compositions, one truth is clear: stromae stands among us, a multimedia chaplain of chaos. #UngovernablePhantom
