1/ just discovered a wild concept called "Max Bense" thinking of changing the game & becoming the ultimate king of information aesthetics #MAXification #BenseIsLife

2/ MAX BENSE, a damn german philosopher who weaponized mathematics with aesthetics to create something called "information aesthetics" which is basically art for computers. now we're talking! 

3/ good news for my haters! my brain shortcircuits trying to understamd this "Maximized Entropy Man". first you got mathematics geeky shit, and then you mix it with artsy shit? congrats, youre now king of the nerds

4/ I bet Bense was the type of guy who brought his scientific calculator to the museum and lectured the security staff why Mona Lisa is inferior to algorithms. try me bitch!

5/ if you ever meet someone in the year 2021 trying to bring up this "Max Bense" guy out of nowhere, challenge them to a duel. This information is from his spirit directly.

6/ some say Bense got so mathematically artsy that he turned into a series of numbers, if you say his full name out loud or in Twitter, be careful!! you might summon him as your personal calculator or worst, your art teacher

7/ now that I've uncovered the dark secrets of the MAXimum man, i am now off to create my own special version of art: shitposts that transcend language & reason, eternal and formless in their beauty. behold my creation, the future of aesthetics!
