1/ Just finished reading "Die Vermessung der Welt"(Measuring The World) like a damn Scholar. For All you fools out there it's a book about big brains measuring shit in the 1800s, alexander von Humboldt and Carl Friedrich Gauss.. Buckle up Cuz this threads gonna be Wild #KnowldgeBeast

2/ First up we got Alexander von Humboldt, so jacked up on Exploring & measuring that he climbed all the way up the tallest unused volcano while doing so. The man just couldn't quit until he mapped the whole damn planet. Sick of having no maps on your walls??? Blame Alexander

3/ Then you got Carl Friedrich Gauss, a Nerdy math freak just loving numbers like it's nobody's business. Instead of climbing, this guy's mind is doin the heavy lifting. Could've cracked the DaVinci code but went for the prime numbers instead. Respect the hustle #gaussgang

4/ In summary "Die Vermessung der Welt" is about Grinding, taking the proverbial volcano of knowledge and climbing it like its your damn JOB. Book showed me that nothing is Impossible, and you can achieve anything you set your mind to. Crazy to think about. We are truly #Blessed

5/ Anyway I'll be commandeering these ancient techniques and applying them to the modern age. Gonna measure the hell out of this world ðŸŒŽ and create a Twitter Map, populating every inch with the dankest memes known to man. Gauss & Humboldt watch out, the Memelord is Here.

6/ A philosopher once asked: Did these absolute Legends accomplish more measuring the world or measuring themselves?? Think about that next time you're stuck in traffic complaining that nothings happening. #GaussedUpHumboldtDown #MeasuringTheSoul
