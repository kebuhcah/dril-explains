1/ alright, buckle the hell up, because its time to enter the twisted world of nibelungenlied, the medieval german epic that combines sex, dragons, and betrayal, a rollercoaster that doesn't end until the ride is soaked in the piss of history

2/ can't wait to share the legendary tale of siegfried the dragonslayer, who has the audacity to bathe in dragon blood #AbsolutelyFeral. This man achieves invincibility, except for, get this, 1 single spot on his back, guaranteed to send future generations to a shitstorm of rage & confusion

3/ kriemhild's golden hair keeps getting in my face as i dive deeper into this epic. marriages are being arranged like lego sets and siegfried marries kriemhild anyway despite brunhild's tantrums. a dumpster fire of #thebachelor drama 

4/ a "friendly contest" turns into a pissing contest and siegfried, the usual super-powered daredevil, is doing dirty work by disguising himself as gunther using a cloak of invisibility #classicfakefriends. poor brunhild must be wondering wtf is happening in her life

5/ the treachery begins. blood is pumped through the veins of this story as hagen of tronje betrays and kills good old siegfried with a cursed spear. if a tale isn't soaking in the blood of its protagonists, is it really worth telling? #backstabbingseason

6/ now things get truly mad: kriemhild's wrath could bring down the rest of the human race. she marries etzel the hun (a dry sequel to siegfried), inciting chaos as part of her revenge plan. cant decide if she's a disney villainess or a medieval bossbitch #BadAndBoujee

7/ kriemhild's revenge gets entirely demented as everyone annihilates each other in a gorgeously grotesque dance of death, bloodied limbs thrown into the relentless gears of fate. this is not the fairy tale wedding i had in mind. 

8/ finally, kriemhild's own head is chopped off, because her revenge must be complete, her guts boiling in the seedy underbelly of this tale. no one stands unscathed, a lesson to all daring to seek power & vengeance. 

9/ in conclusion, nibelungenlied is the spaghettified lachrymation of humanity, wrapped around ancient socl media drama, an ouroboros of treachery & power trips, proving that assholes were canonically created in the middle ages. good night and god bless #nibelungenlied
