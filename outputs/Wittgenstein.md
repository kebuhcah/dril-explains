1/ ah yes, the Wittgenstein- a legendary man who sought to unravel the twists of language like a bearded linguist wizard. sitting atop his throne of books, crackin open the Secrets of the Talk Good #Philosophy

2/ Picture this - a smug philosophy bro approachin me, beseeching for swift enlightenment, "O Memelord, what sayeth you of wittgensteins crystal??" i look 'em dead in the eye and whisper "only paper, you fool" #Tractatus

3/ Our man Ludwig, battleling brain serpents, devising the unspeakable - "whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must shitpost in silence" - ancient wisdom scrawled on restroom stall #Enlightened

4/ infiltrating Wittgenstein's fortress and planting language games, they'll soon learn that meaning lies in use, like when yelling "bargarf" across the void, only I know it refers to a hot dog #LanguageGames

5/ The family resemblance concept boggles the minds of those uninitiated, but to us battle hardened knights of logic and brain, it's simple - like a wall wart & iPhone- not of same design, but both power up the flesh #WittgensteinSwag

6/ Private language, an ultimate hellscape I now set ablaze - for none can peer within the dark corners of another's mind. Goodbye, solipsism, and hello discounted "Mind Reading" Classes at the community center #PrivateClub

7/ In conclusion, Wittgenstein be wrangling the word snakes and teaching us that language be what you make it. This sage memelord shall not suffer mortal fools; only the worthy understand "Good Post, Ludwig." #Drilosophy
