1/7 Ah yes,. the Ultra Fight Carnival,. The Ultimat Feud Contest. where two large men engage in vicious handshake combat after consuming copious amounts of hot dogs and beer. The true sport of kings

2/7 In this hallowed and sacred battle, men pound their fists inside an octagon-shaped prison, testing their ability to evade the deadly referee who seeks to absorb their very life essence. Truly, it is a noble art

3/7 Techniques mastered throughout millennia include the legendary "head punch," the subtle "kick-in-the-face," and, of course, the universally feared "children's choke hold." Individual triumphs in dexterous humiliation.

4/7 Each fighter adorns themselves in the symbolic attire: shorts made from the hide of extinct beasts and gasoline-soaked T-shirts. Nothing says "strength" quite like dying your flesh with the logos of companies that make bald tires & shitty energy drinks

5/7 On this unholy field of war, the two champions earn their "weight class" by fighting a complex series of legal battles with professional attorneys in the parking lot. The winner then uses a device called a "scale" to humiliate the opponent further.

6/7 To be victorious, one must simply pummel their opponent until they resemble a fine meat paste - or simply lull them into submission with the musk of Gatorade-scented body odor. Do not forget to taunt casualties with cries of "I juiced your ass" and "Please unblock me Dana"

7/7 In the end, it is not about brutal violence, nor obliterating one's foe with pure savagery. It is about respect, honor, and cashing in on three seconds of fame by selling truck nutz with the tagline "Legally enforced berries." God Bless the UFC, my friends.
