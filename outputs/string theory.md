1/ alright. im no science man, but here it goes. STRING THEORY - the idea that we are all tiny puppets pulled by cosmic shit-ropes. mind bending? absolutely. chaos reigns. #StringTheory

2/ imagine if you will, a sick guitar bangin out riffs, but it's the UNIVERSE. and the strings arent strings at all, but "strings". very small, very good at keeping the cosmos afloat. #DaddarioOfTheGods

3/ so they say there's like 287 dimensions or some insane horseshit. i dont buy that. im flat as a pancake. but these "strings" vibrate in ways so wild, our dumb asses cant even perceive it. sucks to be us, i guess. #VibrateHigher

4/ Some folks say these strings are smaller than a hot dog stand's chili spread. thats real small. but somehow, they holdentire galaxies together like a seamstress tying a beautiful, fucked up quilt. #QuiltsOfTheVoid

5/ if you touch one of these mighty strings, you may vanish instantly into a parallel universe where you are, paradoxically, a powerful and well respected physics professor. or even worse, a mime. #MimeLife

6/ Just think, each of us losers could be dancing on the end of a string held by some sadistic celestial puppeteer, who takes pleasure in fuxking with us in every conceivable way. imagine it

7/ so that's "String Theory" for you. a real mess of strings, tangled like the headphones in my ass-pocket. infinite dimensions, incomprehensible vibrations, and a warning: be weary of touching the strings. #StringTheory

8/8 Remember, there's plenty of fucked up "Theory" to be discovered: Big Bang, Relativity, Banana Boat. don't stop at "String". but for now let's embrace that we're puppets and keep dancing to the cosmic tune.
