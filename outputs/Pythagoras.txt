1/ Ah, Pythagoras, the long dead fuck who thought numbers were gods or some shit. Worst part is he's hailed as a genius for his mathemavoodoo triangles. #AncientGrease

2/ Me, the mathematical anti-hero, sworn to dissect the Triangle wizard's perverse theorem. A square + B square = Fucking Magic square, bow down to the number lords, pissants.

3/ Listen dipshits, I've measured precisely the length of my TV, my couch, and the distance between them. Had a repressed memory of a bearded old man whispering formularies in my ear. #HauntedByPythagoras

4/ The Realm Of Ghostly Triangles - in which I carefully explain how to transform your worst enemies into Perfect Pythagorean Triplets by forceful wielding of a notoriously sharp protractor.

5/ Triangles rule our skies - The Bermuda Triangle, The Illuminati Pyramid, The Toblerone - why has Pythagoras cursed us with this undying triangle menace? #IsoscelesNightmares

6/ In the ultimate act of defiance, I shall bend every triangle into a circle, rendering Pythagoras completely powerless. Crushed will be every compass that attempts to contain me with a radius.

7/ So I become the One and True Arch-Geometry Warlord, free of Pythagorean bondage, leading the Crusade against Number Cults. May Truth and Cunedgetory reign supreme. #NoMoreTriangles
