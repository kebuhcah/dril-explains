1/ Alright numb skulls, the sovereign memelord himself will now impart wisdom upon your lowly brains. Time to unveil the sinful secrets of "Settlers of Catan" - Get your moist diapers ready, because this is about to get real.

2/ First, slap down the damn cardboard pieces like a pro, to make a sexy hexagon island paradise for pixel vikings. But be warned, my dear shitposters, if you lovingly caress the resources too much they will refuse to perform.

3/ Place those numbers on resource tiles, you may wonder what those numbers mean? I'll have you know, not even the president of the universe knows. One thing though, they're definitely not lottery numbers or my phone password.

4/ Let's talk resources - Wheat, Ore, Brick, Sheep, and for some godforsaken reason, Wood. The sexy quintet of life. Write this down in your journals and scream into the night. These goodies will become your puppets in the grand theater of Catan.

5/ Don't get me started on "the robber" - a morally bereft hoodlum who didn't pay their library fines. This mongrel will cockblock your resources, but face me in a duel & the outcome will be my victory over scum.

6/ Turns consist of rolling, trading, & building. You roll the mischievous dice, begging them to produce wealth. Then you enact the ancient art of swindling your friends like Wall Street banksters. Finally comes building, a nod to our ancient cave-dwelling ancestors.

7/ "I crave victory!", I can already hear your frail voices chime in. Well, listen here nerds; collect those sweet, sweet victory points by building settlements, cities, and having the longest road. It's a marathon, not a sprint. Wise words from the digital messiah himself.

8/ Finally, beware of the dreaded "Seven" - A number cursed by the primordial digits. If you roll this treacherous figure, the robber awakens & wreaks havoc. Send him to the shadow realm (aka someone else's tile) without a shred of mercy.

9/ That's it, you simpletons. I have bestowed upon you the gnarled knowledge of Settlers of Catan, an honor of cosmic proportions. Treat this blessing with respect, and embark upon your journey into the realm of hexes, dice, & tears.

10/ And forever keep in mind that I, the celestial memelord @dril, grace you with the wisdom of my musings. Now go forth and conquer, you brain-thirsty fledglings. Bask in the beauty of the game of Catan. Don't be surprised if your fellow gamers tremble in your presence.
