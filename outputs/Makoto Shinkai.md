1/ ah, yes, the esteemed Makoto Shinkai. a "visonary" anime film genius who refuses to live in my basement and create cartoons for my personal enjoyment. #Coward

2/ They say Shinkai's films, they make the sky look wet...the colors real horny...traversing the space-time continuum to perfect the Art of Sad Teen Love. #MustBeNice

3/ Just watched "Your Name" again after funneled 15 cans of Monster Energy to enhance emotional receptors. cried so hard i accidentaly destroyed my TV with a powerful headbutt.

4/ Makoto Shinkai can make a film about two people longing to touch hands...Meanwhile I touch hands on the bus every day and its suddenly a "crime"? #ButtZone

5/ "Weathering With You" or as I like to call it "Aquatic Love Teens No.1". My sources indicate it was inspired by Shinkai single hardedly stopped a big typhoon with his mighty tears.

6/ when will shinkai make a movie about assholes who drive 200mph down residential streets at 2am & don't have the guts to let me do handstand on the front of their car? #whatimworth

7/ unforunately i must now stop discussing Makoto Shinkai, as whatever i did to the TV has caused it to communicate with local police via smoke signal. expecting SWAT at any moment. Goodbye
