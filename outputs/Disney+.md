1/ disney+: the digital realm where mickey mouse's Big Pants deliver impossibly large streams of Content into the vital artery of my home

2/ fearful of the relentless flow of Childhood Joy my television can hardly tolerate it as disney+ jams fistfuls of cartoons down to fuel my hunger

3/ scrolling through the Disney Roster: mickey mouse - check. Donald Duck - check. Goofy - check. men in black ?? frothing at the mouth to behold their power within the disney+ handcuffs

4/ the Disney+ algorithm presents an infinite series of recommended content, each one tailored to dismantle my primal instincts and shatter my will to resist its seductive whispers

5/ in awe at the Unholy Trinity of streaming: Netflix, hulu, disney+; locked in eternal battle to devour my soul via their monstrous grub-goblin filled tributaries of pain

6/ experiencing Disney+ is like being baptized anew in a pool of ceaseless entertainment, and im floating upon mickey's back, a writhing palate of both power and despair

7/ soon my consciousness shall succumb to the relentless grasp of disney+, as it seeps into our world and mutates the natural order into a kaleidoscope of simulated mouse delights
