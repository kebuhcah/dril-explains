1/ the day has come. the nation's capital is under siege by an army of jacked-up hogs, craving their banquet of freedom. democracy, on life support. I ascend & observe. #Jan6

2/ what started as a gentle kiss with liberty has erupted into a hot tongue affair with chaos. a motley crew of flag-waving cosplay patriots scream, unable to comprehend their own inscrutable desires. the beast has awoken.

3/ they barge through doors and break through barriers. cameras flash, selfies snapped, grandmothers demanding to speak to their congressperson like they're the manager of the world's shittiest Outback Steakhouse.

4/ and lo and behold, the noble viking druid stands majestic amidst the chaos, his mighty horned helmet announcing his arrival to the great hall. "my man," says he, high-fiving a puffed-up militia wannabe.

5/ within the hallowed chambers, desks overturned, papers scrawled with crayon threats that make a kindergarten teacher weep. the smell of fast food and vape juice hangs thick in the air. sweatpants & tactical gear, iconic pair.

6/ outside, overwhelmed by the reek of rebellion, a pack of journalists scrabble to capture every last pixel of the day. after all, they say, gotta give the people something to drink their morning coffee to.

7/ as the sun sets, the once-great warriors slink back into the shadows, their thunderous refrain replaced by a whimper. Arrested, detained, held accountable. yet one question remains: "Where is the god damn toilet?"

8/ In the aftermath, we see fear & confusion exchanged for smug laughter from a thousand armchairs. Twitter chimes in, bidding a hearty farewell to the fallen heroes who mistook madness for valor. For now, the hogs remain silent. #Jan6Aftermath
