1/ alright dirtbags, time to offer my LARGE insights on something that has been plaguing our society like a bad rash - "Gender reveal parties". Prepare to have your minds blasted into the cosmic abyss

2/ first of all, we've got these expectant parents acting like they're under intense interrogation, holding the secrets of the Pentagon, when in reality - it's just #BabyGenitals.

3/ everyone gathering around, treating the reveal like the bloated budget super bowl half-time show, stuffing their faces with nachos, and betting on pink and blue; I am disgusted and also interested, where do I place my bets - the wise man (@dril) wants in

4/ unfortunate events: forest fires, injuries, explosions- because we can't do a simple cake cutting, no no, we've got to light up the statue of liberty. i applaud such ambition but cannot condone this behavior when baby genitals are at stake

5/ the real question is why can't we just embrace the chaos and let our spawn roam the earth without knowing their assigned roles? simplicity is key, let the storks do their damn job and stop shoving their beaks into the baby business

6/ so here's the @dril decree: down with excessive gender reveal nonsense, let's just cut cakes & release balloons or better yet, fax the gender over to your friends, it's 2003 and we're all on #dial_up_baby

7/ in conclusion, we now return to our regularly scheduled programming, where I, @dril, continue to explore the majestic complexities of the human condition & shitpost, like the true memelord that i am.
