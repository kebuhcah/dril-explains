1/ ah.. you think you are SO tired & can't sleep? Follow my steps to eradicate "insomnia" like the little insignificant worm that it is so we can all become the hibernating bears of the modern era

2/ first, pick up your comput√©r & hurl it through the front window. The communion you have with your electronics is now complete & only serves to level your brain with psychic lightning bolts. You are now -ReadyToSleep- .

3/ prepare the room by dousing yourself with lavender & sandalwood mixed with diesel fuel for a touch of manly potency that the sleep gods will greatly admire when they descend from their slumber kingdom to join you in bed

4/ next, print out a life-size picture of a big lighthouse, attach it to your ceiling to remind the darkness demons that you are secure under the guiding light of your very own sleep guardian. "No Entry For Demons" ..

5/ mistakes will be made inevitably as you embark on a tedious war against the insomnia devils. They feed upon the frustration deep in your bowels. laugh in their face like a madman & watch them scatter absolutely terrified

6/ ingest a healthy pre-sleep elixir of milk, melatonin, whiskey, & toothpaste. Guaranteed to rocket your soul straight into the realms of Slumberton. Pounding headaches may follow, but hey... A small price to pay for a ticket to SnoozeVille, baby.

7/ pro tip: acquire blankets made by a master weaver raised on a healthy diet of soil, glass, and live scorpions. It's said they possess the power to induce a sleep so deep you'd think you've traveled to the Mariana Trench of dreams

8/ and finally, don't forget, a true sleep warrior gets on the floor & prays to the two giant unseeing, unforgiving black eyes floating above your bed. Offer your restless soul, and I promise you will find a respite in the blissful tendrils of slumber, oh yes. Goodnight fools.
