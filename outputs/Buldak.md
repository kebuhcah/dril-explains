1/ just found out about this insane korean treat called "Buldak".. folks it's a spicy chicken sent directly from the devil's own cookbook or something. life is filled with surprises

2/ it's called "Buldak" but some guys call it "Fire Chicken." I cant decide on which name is more terrifying, as both invoke apocalyptic imagery in my mind. Do we dare consume the flames?

3/ imagine "FIRE chicKEney" as a demonic chef conjures powerful herbs and ingredients while laughing manically, hurling handfuls of spice into hellish cauldron. Yeah, that's how I imagine Buldak was born 

4/ honestly, my heat tolerance hasn't been the same since slamming 7 ghost pepper milkshakes in '09, but I bow to the flaming chicken overlords. #BuldakMasterRace engage

5/ rise up true heat seekers!! we wanna eat food that doubles as a military grade weapon, we crave mouth napalm, a throat dive-bomber. Niche gourmand community is thriving on this

6/ to hell with bland poultry. to hell with scared chicken. We have been blessed with a new culinary messiah blaring into our mouths: the Buldak prophecy has been fulfilled.

7/ in conclusion, if you're tired of mundane foods and crave a taste of delicious fire, take a leap of faith, and dare to embrace the Buldak Experience. may it melt your brain with pure essence. #FireChickenEmissary
