1/7 alright you sweaty gamers, listen up. time to put down your controllers and get educated on the ancient mystical art of "Planking". no, not the pirate shit. the bone-crushing horizontal pose that conquers the whole god damn world, one surface at a time. #BlastYourCore

2/7 first things first, Planking ain't for cowards. gotta get firm like a 2x4 lumber to prove you're the master of the universe. stomach Down, limbs straight; essentially become the flesh & blood mattress for ungrateful world. Irony? yeah. But yr back pain will be exquisite.

3/7 the golden rule of Planking: it only counts if you look like youre in excruciating pain whilst channeling the wrath of SunGod Raâ„¢. show me a Planker who isnt suffering & i'll show you a common LIAR, curiously walking backwards, away from his own legacy.

4/7 now you ask, "why Plank"? perhaps you think im some sort of health nut? that i give two flying shits about the "core strength" of the common man?? hardly. Planking is more than physical posture, it's an ideology, doctrine, universal harmony that binds us together as one.

5/7 yes, the world mocks us. they label us as obsolete, lunatics, stuck in 2011. i'll be damned if someone calls my Planking "cultural rot" as they consume the latest "how to TikTok dance" tutorial on Youtube. Our spines may be horizontal, but our integrity is vertical, fools.

6/7 Picture this: thousand of men & women, all rigidly Planking for the sheer thrill of respect. the ones who dooming us for our passions being burdened by the human shelve laid before them. the world grovel in respect for the ones who choose to plank!! #Inevitable

7/7 so let it be known: we, the proud citizens of Planet Plank, transcend popular culture. transforming into rectilinear gods, our steadfast perseverance to lay down the law & conquer every evil table, cruel bench, and ungrateful floor will become the mother of legends. #Amen
