1/9 - ah, so the man, the myth, the legend himself, " Rupert Murdoch", or as i like to call him, old Rupey.  the billion dollar man who's got just about every news outlet in his giant crab like claws #MurdochsMystery

2/9 - some might say "he Shapes the Media" and id say, damn right he does . he molds it like the wicked witch of the news, turning our brains into soft Play-Doh under his evil thrall #PlaydohBrain

3/9 - it's common knowledge of course that rupert is actually 230 years old and bathes in the blood of young interns to keep his reptile skin moist, all while controlling eveyr aspect of our lives #moist

4/9 - a powerful man indeed, but rupert murdoch's Achilles' heel is the humble but devastaing tweet.  the 280 character truth serum is poisonous to his wealthy flesh, yet we keep tweeting. we keep fighting #modernsociety

5/9 - old murdoch has all the money, but not the peace that good content provides. you see, his one true wish is to be a popular tweeter, but no amount of riches can bring him the recognition his cold heart desires #ilikethemoneyAlot

6/9 - rumor has it he controls us through the weather- when we're all a little cold, a little damp, we turn to his media machine for some warmth. and just like that, he keeps his sinister grip on our consciousness #likeafamiliarblanket

7/9 - his power grows stronger in dark times, as we cling to his news feeds like baby birds to mother's tit, he feeds on our fear and vulnerability. they don't call him murdoch the magnificent for nothing #circleofliars

8/9 - but perhaps i am too hard on old Rupey. after all, he is just a man, a lizard king, trying to conquer the world through media manipulation. aren't we all just human beings trying to do our best, in a world gone mad #humanmortals

9/9 - in conclusion, rupert murdoch may control the media, the weather, and perhaps our very souls, but he will never have the sweet satisfaction of shitposting like a normal everyday shitbag like you and me. embrace your power #shitpostersunite
