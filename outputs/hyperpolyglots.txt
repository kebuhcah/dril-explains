1/ alright buckle up shitheads, it's time to dive deep into the twisted world of "hyperpolyglots" - the freaks who can't stop learning languages like it's some kind of diabolical RPG skill tree. #Hyperpolyglotmania

2/ Im told these twisted bastards can speak 10, 20, even 50 languages. conjuring whatever ancient language they want like a linguistic crypt keeper. A goblin with a silver tongue if you will. #MouthfulOfBabel

3/ thinking about how hyperpolyglots are the final boss of every foreign language course. universities scrambling to protect their fragile lecturers from these linguistic hulks before they blow the whole curriculum wide open #LanguageNightmare

4/ Hyperpolyglots are the ultimate weapon of linguistics. when the government needs to disarm a language bomb, they send in one of these freaks. tears streaming down a proud "polyglot mother"s face as her son dissects an obscure language puzzle, without breaking a sweat #patriotism

5/ any time I've tried to learn a new language I end up sobbing on the floor, surrounded by dictionaries and empty coffee cups. meanwhile the sickos known as "hyperpolyglots" are snorting Rosetta Stone discs like they're lines of linguistic cocaine #LanguageDealer

6/ I, myself a humble master of the english language. A simple artisan, crafting precision tweets. King of the english language. Bowing only to the dreaded Hyperpolyglot council. #IRenounceAllOtherLanguages

7/ in conclusion, hyperpolyglots are the elusive language wizards - scribes of the modern age. simultaneously feared for their skills and respected for decoding the cryptic menus at authentic foreign restaurants. #HyperpolyglotsAmongUs
