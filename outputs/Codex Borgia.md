1/6 "Thread time: diving ass-deep into the mysterious as hell realm of ancient Mesoamerican madness known as "Codex Borgia". Strap on your codpiece & sport your finest leather-bound hat for this journey. #CodexBorgia #MemeLord

2/6 "Imagine - you're just chillin' in 15th century Mexico, doing whatever the hell you do & BAM! - this bizarre looking manuscript of epic proportions appears. Moleskine wishes they had the balls to produce something as wild as this shit! #AncientFlex"

3/6 "Some say the 'Codex Borgia' was a guide for the hottest pre-Columbian astrological rituals & divination practices. Others say it's the hidden secret menu at Taco Bell. The world may never know. #FeedTheBeast #BorgianAstrology"

4/6 "Jealous colonial Euro-powers tried to suppress the big-asCodex Borgia energy, but no amount of hatin' could stop its raw, divine, meme-slinging force. The art remains a testament to the vigorous vitality of Mesoamerica. #HatersGonnaHate #IndigenousPower"

5/6 "So, let's take a minute to appreciate the unbeatable color schemes, page layouts, & sacred goddamn illustrations that these early visionaries threw down in the name of style. Eat your heart out, minimalist smartphone apps. #GraphicDesign #AncientPunk"

6/6 "In conclusion, Codex Borgia is the ultimate ancient mystic flex & shall always be a reminder that we were meant to keep conquering the frontiers of meme knowledge. #CodexBorgia #StayWoke"
