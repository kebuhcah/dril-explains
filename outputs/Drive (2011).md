1/ Just watched "Drive " (2011) movie.... it's basically Ryan Gooseling doing sick drive moves and wearing cool jackets.... the Michael Bay of jackets.. Respect

2/ all these movie critics saying "Drive is a neo-noir crime film" when its clearly about Drive Kings showing off their driving skills while looking hot as shit. real subtle you guys

3/ hold the phone critics... if "Drive" is so damn good, how come nobody's shouting about the cars used? a ford mUStang??? more like a Ford Must-ANGRY. sorry folks, no Oscars for the invisible cars

4/ everyone's going on about how amazing the soundtrack in that Drive movie is but they dont have even one song from the Geo Metros of Cornholing soundtrack. If that ain't a "mis-step" I don't know what is! 

5/ "Drive" Movie could use a bit of gamer pizzazz. My proposal: Reskin Ryan Gooslington as Sonic the Hedgehog, now we're talking.. Car fast, hedgehog faster! Dril fixes H-wood once again

6/ anyway in conclusion, "Drive"(2011) is the most important film about a man who drives his car and breaks people's jaws with a hammer, while listening to good tunes. No arguing that.
