2/12: i will remind all My Followers: I am NOT the Legal keeper for this 3d gun wisdom. do NOT use this to disrespect the almighty "Code of Conduct" that haunts our lives. become master of your own domain with the devil's firearm

3/12: first, procure printer of three dimensions. none of this two dimesnsions shit. fool's game. we not printin beyblades. we are craftinf firearms, from the stygian depths of the internet Mainframe

4/12: ASSEMBLE army of blueprints. print a big number. compromise with Sleep if needed. HAnd of God guiding your mouse to track down the forbidden file-"Gun_3d_859.xyz". experts tell me the 'xyz' stands for eXtremely Ychoice Zweapon"
