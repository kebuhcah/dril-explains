1/ intigiued by tales of violent cowboy times, i delve into hte hellish pages of "Blood Meridian" only to be consumed whole by a maelstrom of gore and metaphors the likes of which ive never seen

2/ "Blood Meridian" is like the unholy union of Cormac "the Corm" McCarthy and a pound of raw nightmare drenched in biblical symbolism. No amount of gamer brain can prepare you for the Journey it takes you on

3/ protagonist of "Blood Meridian" seems to wander around deserts like an absolute madman , unscrewing skulls of various innocent & guilty alike while I attempt to absorb this dense prose through osmosis, pleading for the knowledge

4/ amidst the brutal showdowns & twisted morality, there stands out one man, Judge Holden: embodiment of evil, arch-memer and chaos whisperer. If he is not the most terrifying literary figure of all time, i shall seize tweeting forever 

5/ finished reading "Blood Meridian" in just under 700 days. am now unlocked to reach the status of cowboy scholar, forever muttering the ill wisdoms i have gained from this dark baptism.

6/ in conclusion, "Blood Meridian" is a crucible of violence, metaphysical debates, and stark descriptions of human depravity that, i must admit, conveys its message with the cleanliness of a freshly washed truck. hats off to you, Cormac, m'man
