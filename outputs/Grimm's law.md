Tweet 1: just learned about "grimm's law". apparently evidence that the brothers grimm were once majestic beings controlling the very fabric of LANGUAGE

Tweet 2: imagining my room full of linguists, rocking back & forth in their seats, whispering "grimm's law" as i unknowingly open a new dimension in the understanding of words

Tweet 3: grimm bros no longer write fairy tales, now only focus on shifting consonants around like mad men, giving a big middle finger to language norms

Tweet 4: some sickos think that grimm's law is only about sounds in languages over time, but i know the real power lies in weaponizing the consonant shifts. woe to my enemies

Tweet 5: skeptics say "wint grimm's law is ancient history" but every time i intentionally mispronounce a word i can taste the raw force of lost linguistic energy

Tweet 6: behold grimm's wrath: "father" becomes "pader." I accept this curse on behalf of all fathers who wear new balance sneakers & hold the TV remote with authority

Tweet 7: as a lawbreaker and grimm's law expert, i will now exclusively use germanic consonants, turn casual conversations into baffling cryptograms, language is my plaything
