1/13 ah yes, "Jefe Bazos" , the man who made finger tapping on the screens of the telephonic apparatus a means of getting Essential items like toilet posters, beef jerky hats and 12 pound jelly beans #BezosConnundrum 

2/13 Jeff belzos once said, "your margin is My opportunity." can someone PLEASE explain what margin he meant? i believe it is a coded message to buy every used Ford Festiva. #FestivaManifesto

3/13 they tell me bezos eats bugs....absolutely chowing down on evil beetles that dare to disturb the inner workings of his mighty Amazon machines. The BugPocalypse cant win.

4/13 critics say jeff benzo wealth inordinate... that it's UNfair. but consider: he could be using that money to build us a Dyson sphere or a Moon casino. true innovation knows no bounds

5/13 Bezos stepping down as CEO of amazon so he can focus on main passion: setting the world record for lifting the most dead batteries with a single hand... or so ive heard 

6/13 ah, my personal favorite, the "Dilbert Tier" of Amazon Prime members forced to dress as comic character "dilbert" for free electronical books. thank you, Jeff Bezos.

7/13 ass blasted twitter warriors denigrating bezzos for such a fortune! "seize his wealth" they say. but do they even Know how to operate the big lasers and high tech machines..? i think not.

8/13 Mr. Bezos, forgive my insolence but must i be paraded around in my Blue Origin Spacewear in front of my city council as proof of our zeal for rocketry? how much is too much

9/13 it is a known fact that jeff bezos has never blinked in his entire life not even once. true winners need not blink

10/13 i've heard the whispers .. the jeff bezos clones lurking amongst us, ready to deploy droves of amazon drones at a moment's notice, armed with only the finest in self-help literature.

11/13 MY proposal: we give jef beoz every ounce of metal in the earth's crust. let there be no car uncrushed, no fork unbroken. in return, we get premium memberships and a chance at mars colonization.

12/13 some ask if 'bezos' is an anagram. Indeed, it may be. a rearranging reveals "Boz Sez"â€”perhaps a prophetic message from our Amazon overlord, the great Bozo. #AmazonProphecy

13/13 jeff bezoz, the man, the myth, the rich uncle we never had... prepare yourselves for the future space race it wont be jeff bezos against musks, its humans vs unblinking machines
