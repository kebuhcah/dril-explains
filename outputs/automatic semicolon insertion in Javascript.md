1/ am i supposed to just ACCEPT that JavaScript, a language for online Wizards, does "Automatic Semicolon Insertion" for me?? i am no baby ?? i will insert my own damn semicolons #BossOfSemicolons

2/ apparently all these tiny semi-colons get magically FUSED to our code by the well-intentioned yet sneaky tech goblins called "ASIs", just cause they think we cant handle it!!? #NotTodayMrASI

3/ heres the deal: when yer computer thinks its smarter than tHe user with its nose in the air, itll sneak a little ';' right in there like a ';' butler #Don'tTreadOnMyCode

4/ ASI Comes and gives Code a kiss â€” Starts with newline?? gotchu mr. coder. just slappin that ';' for ya. Returns, Throws or Breaks a statement?? one smooch for good luck! We dont need these kisses! #UnwarrantedCodeKisses

5/ To DEFEAT AUTO SEMICOLON INSERTION: simply use a semi colon!! no place for small semicolon;;; put them EVERYWHERE; instead of letting these tiny ';' take over the JavaScript empire; Code revoluTION! #SemicolonWarrior

6/ seriously though, pay respec to ';' - theyre just lil guys, doin their job. anyway, automatic semicolon insertion is there, use it OR not, be the master OF your own damn code;;, #SentientCodeAtPeace
