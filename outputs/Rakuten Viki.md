1/ just found out about this cryptic trinket called "Rakuten Viki" it's not some sort of Grail puzzle box, threatening to unleash lost demons. it's just TV stuff for your brain toilet. #ascended

2/ the legends speak of a site that melds the realms of "drama" "movies" and "TV" from far off mystical lands: Asia. it's Rakuten Viki. the rumors are true. fear not weary traveler; it's time to binge & consume the forbidden media like a voracious dragon. 

3/ attempting to use my unrivaled media knowledge gained only from the gates of hell to navigate the strange UI of Rakuten Viki. my comrades, we are but droplets in the vast sea of content. #humbled

4/ "rakutenvikipedia" -- sounds like the sacred texts, but it's not some forgotten tome. it's how I plan to unravel the mystery of Rakuten Viki. I'm on this quest, not for wealth or power, but for the truth buried within these pixelated archives. #enlightened

5/ can someone tell me if my Viki subscriptions grants me VIP access to the Fourth Circle of Hell or if thats an additional charge? seems odd they don't offer that package on this so-called world media hub. #infernalPreferences
