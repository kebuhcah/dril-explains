1/69 The year is 500 B.C. The Byzantine generals are all huddled together, desperately trying to decide if they should ATTACK or if they should DEFEND. LMAO these guys are pissed off

2/69 Trust is hard to come by in this so called "Ancient History" time. Communication is done thru some dude on a horse or some crap. i call it "The Pony Express for smart people"

3/69 anyway these General idiots know they have a problem: they gotta send messages to each other to coordinate their attack, but theres a bunch of snakes in the grass - Traitors. Betrayers. Mind criminals.

4/69 This problem of traitors n liars all up in their business is what we in the meme economy call "The byzantine Generals Problem". Picture it: slow ass horses, flapping banners, and the stench of treachery in the air

5/69 To solve this "ancient nerd problem", the Generals gotta use MATH. thats right, even back then they had to rub numbers all over their stupid sweaty hairy bodies to get problems solved. pathetic.

6/69 The idea is simple: find a protocol where they can agree on a decision, even if some jackass generals are sipping that traitor juice & screwing up the messages. forging letters like it's an Amish catfish scheme

7/69 Now picture this, they got messengers riding these slow ass horses back and forth, while the traitors are laughing in their horny togas. how can you trust the information when even the air is full of lies

8/69 today we got computers using this old math nerd problem. we call it byzantine fault tolerance. its like a fancy way to say "i'm so smart, i use ancient horse messaging technology to handle my transactions"

9/69 Look, were all just pawns in this game of life. some of us are slopping up that deceitful mud, others are trying to secure our bitcoin so were not getting played by cyber ghost bitches. stay woke

10/69 ill say this now, I crack open the parchment sealed with the byzantine generals personal seal, my horse trembling under my massive weight like a true warrior, and i solemnly prepare my troops to ATTACK. dm for emotional support
