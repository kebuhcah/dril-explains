1/ ah, the humble "Explosive stick".. or as you may know from my upcoming 1200-page novel on the subject, "Dynamite lover's KISS" #Important #FragileHearts 

2/ "🧨"..the emoji that shaped more lives than most Politicians. an essential in any arsonist's toolkit. the Rare Element; capable of instigating Laughter as well as Fear. #EmojiLife #BangBangBang 

3/ it goes without saying that we must respect the 🧨 for its incredible power, but also, it's a Classic Symbol for partygoers to tag in their embarrassing facebook posts as they Chow Down on a dog slider.. 

4/ we cannot hide from the Dark Truth. in 1337, the world's first emoji-controlled iCBM launch was initiated with a 🧨. we have since evolved but it is essential to remember the journey #ColdWarEmoji

5/ "BigExplosion-ophiles" may be tempted to downplay the 🧨 emoji and promote more advanced models of Bombastics, but it remains the Pumpkin Spice Latte of the Explosive World #EnduringClassic

6/ Most importantly, wielding the 🧨 emoji is a sacred responsibility, only to be taken on by those who have tasted both the ✌️ and the 💔 of the world. May we honor this symbol and all it represents.. and never pee while handling one.

7/ THREAD-END #ImpeachGod
