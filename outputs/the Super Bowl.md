1/9: Ah yes, The Super Bowl - The annual gathering of sports fanatics, commercials, and a gigantic bowl of queso dip that could choke an elephant. The time has come, my "dudes"! Let us embark upon a sports Odyssey

2/9: Imagine over 100 million adult males watching together as football players, donned in their battle armor, clench their collective cheeks and grapple each other in the blood soaked fields. Poetry in motion.

3/9: commercials, we are blessed with them. Celebrate 30 seconds of financial drains honed to an artform. A true ode to capitalism. Pee breaks and family discussions commence as the soothing melody of "REESES PUFFs" fade away.

4/9: The halftime show– when sacred Music deities descend with us mortals, to sing and dance in the synchronization of the spheres. some say it transcends any other moment in human history, and some say they are liars. Choose your fate wisely.

5/9: Props to the flock of musclebound men who get paid to scream & tackle each other, fulfilling the ancient Greco-Roman homoerotic prophecy. Ah the warrior spirit. Intimidation of the Enemy clearly still stands as the world's Original sin.

6/9: as we clutch our foam fingers in anticipation, let us not forget the traditional "eating of the wings" as if we needed a reason for devouring them; honoring our fallen brethren, the noble buffalo. God, please forgive us for our flesh binges

7/9: One must not disregard the ritual of the illegal gambling sphere, is it truly a Super Bowl without betting your next week's paycheck on a hunch that the winning team has a bird mascot? Embrace the chaos.

8/9: But lo, the true casualties of the Super Bowl, the forgotten ones. The battalion of lumpy couches, recliners, and futons, wilted beneath an army of sweaty, beer-soaked souls. RIP to my fallen Lazy-boy, lost to the fray so many years ago.

9/9: And so, as the dust settles on another victorious night of sport, obscenely large belt buckles and laughably gigantic grins. The Super Bowl teaches us unity in divisive times– where we all band together to witness the fantastical world of American football.
