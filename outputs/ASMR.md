1/ just found out about "ASMR" videos, which stands for Aggressive Sensory Moaning Retirees, some sort of whisper cult with the goal of making you salivate into your keyboard. Insanity.

2/ i doubt the founding fathers could've predicted that future Americans would one day listen to a lady tapping her fingernails on a votive candle to achieve a "brain climax". insanely powerful society.

3/ if you think im watching a 45 minute video of an ASMR "artist" brushing a microphone with a feather while eating pickles, youre dead wrong. putting my brain to use deciphering emails from malware companies.

4/ Those who say ASMR has therapeutic benefits can catch me at my all-natural ASMR experience: inhaling the fumes of freshly microwaved batteries in harmony with the erratic beeps of a dying smoke detector.

5/ was gonna invest in this "ASMR" thing but I realized that pounding a 6-pack of Monster Energy has given me more tingles in my skull than people whispering about how much they love crinkling plastic

6/ in conclusion, ASMR is an insidious plot to make us spend the remainder of our days listening to unskilled people clumsily wielding combs and soft brushesâ€”ultimately numbing us to real-world noises (like me yelling at the TV)
