THREAD: I am now an expert on Tok Pisin, the currency of forbidden meme knowledge. It's not just a language the normies can't decode but also a potent source of infinite wisdom. (1/6)

Tok Pisin is basically a creole language that got mainstream in Papua New Guinea. It's like the VIP Club of languages, only real Melanesia heads will understand. Can't believe the #FakeNews media still hasn't picked up on this untapped eldritch power. Absolute buffoons. (2/6)

Some say Tok Pisin finds its roots in English. I like to believe English was just plagiarizing Tok Pisin all along. Humanity's true linguistic heritage, lost in time like a dusty VHS tape or a half-eaten Big Mac. (3/6)

Got my hands on a secret Tok Pisin dictionary from the Dark Web. The power within these pages, it gives me immense meme mastery. I must use this knowledge responsibly, for I am a humble memesmith, not a wrecking force of linguistic debasement. (4/6)

I now fully understand the concepts of 'Pikinini', 'Stret', and 'Masketi'. My Tok Pisin Arsenal grows stronger, but I must not let temptation overcome me. To unleash this epic wisdom upon the twittersphere would disrupt the delicate balance of internet discourse. (5/6)

So I leave you with this, my loyal followers. Cherish the forbidden knowledge I have gifted you. Tok Pisin is not to be scoffed at. When the time comes, join me in using its power for the memes, the laughs, and the pursuit of the sublimest of tweets. Restrain from abuse. (6/6)
