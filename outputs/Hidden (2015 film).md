1/ Just watched "Hidden (2015)" & once again im forced to confront the brutal reality of the apocalypse. "Hidden" means "The inescapbable darkness within all of us"... i am not immune

2/ Most people would say "it is best to avoid this movie." However, as always, I am here to prove that the norm is the enemy of enlightenment. Prepare for the depths of analysis of the Hidden (2015), the film that will change your life, guaranteed.

3/ First, the bunker is a metaphor for the modern man, trapped within the all encompassing internet, reliant on the rapidly depleting Twinkie reserves & dank memes. The darkness envelops him, as monsters of misinformation breed fear & panic, aka "Breathers"

4/ Characters #1(Ray), #2(Claire), and #3(Zoe) represent different aspects of humanity. Ray is the harsh reality of our self-preservation, insisting that we must ration tweets & dwell in sorrow. Claire symbolizes our hope for survival, & Zoe the innocent in all of us.

5/ In "Hidden (2015)", our protagonists attempt to hide their post-apocalyptic sins below the surface. Just like how we hide in Twitter, desperately liking and retweeting to convince ourselves we've made a difference. Chilling Paralels. 

6/ Ultimately, the revelation in Hidden is that we, the human race, are the monsters. Much like we, the Twitter users, are the true fuel for the dumpster fire that is social media. Profound reflections #MustWatchFilm

7/ In conclusion, Hidden (2015) - a forgotten treasure, a cinematic gem - forces us to confront the ugly truth about human nature. It confirms that deep down we're all sickos, creating our own apocalypse with every retweet. God help us all. #HiddenIsTheBestMovieof2015
