just heard about this so called "Processing" language for artists & nerds. time to unleash the untapped power of my brain & create Art using lines of Code. #masterCoder

first things first, let's install this bad boy. can't wait to graffiti the digital space with my genius algorithms. ignoring the documentation as the code flows through me like a river. #processingInstallationChaos

ok, the first mission as a master coder, draw a rectangle. how hard can it be? I've been drawing rectangles since i was a baby

```
void setup() {
  size(400, 400);
}

void draw() {
  rect(100, 100, 200, 300);
}
```

i can already sense the power of the digital gods as i spawn ellipses all over the canvas with the wrath of a madman

```
void setup() {
  size(400, 400);
}

void draw() {
  ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 50, 50);
}
```

growing bored of 2D shapes, time to unleash the fury of beautiful colors & gradients. cant stair at a plain grayscale world any longer

```
void setup() {
  size(400, 400);
}

void draw() {
  background(255, 0, 0);
  fill(0, 255, 0);
  rect(100, 100, 200, 200);
}
```

Apparently, we can also control time? I am now the master of both space & time in my digital domain
```
void setup() {
  size(400, 400);
}

void draw() {
  background(0);
  float x = map(sin(frameCount * 0.01), -1, 1, 0, width);
  ellipse(x, height/2, 50, 50);
}
```

just found out there's a whole community of these processing devotees, sharing techniques & tips. joining forces with my fellow coding wizards to expand our digital domain. Our influence grows. #processingCultEnrollment
