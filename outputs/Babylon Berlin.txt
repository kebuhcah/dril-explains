1/ just discovered a rare gem called "Babylon Berlin". no, it's not about the ancient city ruled by Hammurabi, but a sexy crime German show with dancing & guns. thats right. Pimp Parade. #HammurabiWouldBeProud

2/ 1920s Berlin. Jazz flappers everywhere. People drinking and plotting. communist detectives acting like sherlock holmes. A mysterious train full of soviet gold. all this in ONE program. my brain is melting into steam

3/ trying to grasp this Babylon Berlin lore. infiltrating the shadowy world of police corruption and elite decadence with nothing but a pocket full of candy and a heart full of courage #DrilDoesBerlin

4/ "Who is Dril?" They say in the dimly lit bar. "He is the man who will unravel the secrets of this city." I reply, as I out drink every German in the joint. my tweets go down smooth like schnaps

5/ scene: man on dance floor twists near me. "Hey, Gräftepaül." he barks. "What's with the leggings?" Im wearing my iconic superman pajamas underneath my suit to remind myself of the heroes I must emulate in this perilious world

6/ befriending a fascist general with a hot dog factory. learning about his sinister designs while eating delicious dogs. i call this the "meat of confusion" strategy. No one can stop me now #HotDogDiplomacy

7/ espionage, betrayal, forbidden love. i face it all in this Babylon Berlin adventure. uncovering so much intrigue it could power a small car. do not underestimate the mind of an internet expert

8/ where is it all leading, you ask? well, let's just say ive got a one way ticket on that Soviet gold train, and i wont hesitate to yeet some villains when the time comes. history is watching #BabylonDril, fin.
