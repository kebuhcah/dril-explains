1/ im now being forced to enter my brain into the hellscape that is "Europa League" - a sports ordeal that jerks football out of its sincere realms onto the dark crousel of irony #ChairRollingFast

2/ behold Europa League - a pulsating sphere of sports dilemmas, writhing with rage from footballers who, banished from Champion's paradise, drown their sorrows in gory battle to regain clout #europingToGlory

3/ Europa League - a bastardized off-shoot of the champions league or as i call it Champions Lite, for when u want a taste of victory but u also are ok with pretending actual winners don't exist #LiteBoysClub

4/ as my sagacious followers, u must kwow that participation in Europa League can only be achieved by failing to be the top 1-4 within national circles-so they can fester with the "second best" title forever on their titanic struggle #OutOfTheTopBoysPoolParty

5/ this saga of football orphanization lasts 2 Nightmares long, thanks to UEFA Spacetime Algorithmâ„¢, tormenting audiences to endure a carnival of scheduling, where each match is mind-expander on this torture dimension #WarpSpeedDatesFromHell

6/ Europa League - like discovering a shitty rock band in parallel universe while trapped in dimension of failure, u resign to their stale tunes bcz u can never fully appreciate the sweet Symphony of Victory #AlmostButNoteQuiteHeartBeats

7/ fear not noble followers for at the end this eternal football inferno 1 team emerges victorious as Lord of Europa - a hollow crown indeed & brief respite for the path to Champions League beckons once more #TheQuestContinuesNextSeason

8/ my brain feels like a football kicked in2 a volcanel now - but i leave u w/ this truth: europa league, the toughest test of human patience. the searing crucible in which we burn away our expectations 4 gods #FootBallGambit4Mortals
