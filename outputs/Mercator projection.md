1/ "ah, the "Mercator" projection, a tool devised in 1569 by the ultimate freak himself, Gerardus Mercator. imagine—fear gripping your trembling heart—YET having the audacity to create our world as flat. Typical cartographer madness. #BossOfMaps #TheWorldIsntFlat"

2/ "First rule of Cartography Club: Inflate land masses, distort reality. Do not fear, for the constant web of conspiracy is alive and well in the realm of maps. The Mercator projection? More like a fever dream from the mind of God. #ProjectionInsurrection #MapEtiquette"

3/ "when the Mercatury rises–the world flattens–land masses huddle together like shitposting wizards–cape of good hope becomes Cape of Fat Hope—all for the love of navigation. #FearTheProjection #TenThousandShipsStray"

4/ "thank you mercator projection, for enabling colonialism while confusing sailors for centuries. dear ignorant sailors—immediately lost at sea—nothing generates more shivers than that 'Ah Shit' moment after realizing a Mercator Tricked you. #SadSailorTales #LostInDistortionLand"

5/ "in absolute awe of the size of those Greenlandic lads. Absolute units. Mercator is the ultimate hype man if your land mass is the arctic. #SizeMatters #ColdBoldGreenland"

6/ "Finally, an undeniable truth–round Earth society forced to kneel before the merciless Mercator projection. a sinister circle, forever flattened by cartographic sorcery. #OurFlatOverlord #CircleMeetsSquare"
