zhuangzi says we all living in this thing called "dream of a butterfly" - is it possible to buy this "dream" on deep web or perhaps from my local pharmacist asking for a friend

the more i learn about zhuangzi the clearer it becomes that life is an endless cycle of getting owned and owning others - a cosmic balance if you will. my haters are necessary.

ponder this - zhuangzi's description of the utopia where people live with no rules, no titles, going from birth 2 death in perfect chaos - this is in fact the true essence of being Online

chugging mountain dew and pondering the ancient texts like a true high iq gamer. if life a burden why do i shred this half-pipe so damn good. zhuangzi, can you explain this

in conclusion, zhuangzi teaches us that existence is like a dril tweet...intense, inexplicable and bordering on the edge of madness. we are all riding the twisted roller coaster of life, my friends.
