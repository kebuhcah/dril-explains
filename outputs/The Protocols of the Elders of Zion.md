1/18 alright jackoffs, buckle up because it's time to explain the cursed pile of horse-shit known as The Protocols of The Elders Of god-damned Zion. #SickOfThisShit

2/18 This hellish doomsday document, which people believed in like it's the gospel of diarrhea-mongers, claims to be written by some council of Jewish Wizards – as if that's a fuckin' thing. #WizardAssholes

3/18 Written like a cryptic parody of a bad Shakespeare play, this grease-stained napkin has somehow made its rounds in Conspiracy Dumbshit-Town. Many lunatics spread it like COVID-69. #EnjoyTheTrash

4/18 Some slug-brained morons would have you believe it's a "powerful blueprint for World Domination" handed down by a secret cabal of Jewish leaders, but guess what, it's fake as my totally legitimate Rolex. #AllHailMyRolex

5/18 There are people who swear by this text, which, probably born from the balls of Satan himself or whatever, says that Jews are doing things like turning goyim into slaves and then celebrating with a glass of melted gold. #TotalBullshitfolks

6/18 Turns out this ass-blasting word magician named Sergei Nilus, a guy so wrapped up in conspiracies, he probably thinks clouds are made of piss, propagated this sad piece of conspiracy toilet-paper. #ThanksSergei

7/18 Sadly, the impact of The Protocols of The Elders of Zion isn't just limited to the inbred, tin foil hatted Redditors. Historical villains like Hitler used this "work" as a lame-ass excuse for their unethical rampages. #NotCoolHitler

8/18 Remember that time when Henry Ford—a tycoon who probably powered his cars by burning ego and cash—got obsessed with this document? Yeah, I don't wanna say exactly what I'd do to his dumbass Model T, but it'd involve a crowbar and a blowtorch. #FuckModelT

9/18 Along with the rumors of lizard people running the world, the Earth being flat, and the Moon being made of government mind-control cheese, The Protocols of The Elders of Zion ranks as one of the most bullshit global conspiracies. #BathInTheBS

10/18 Fun fact: The origin of this document? A french political satire, dragged through the mud and fermented into conspiracy garbage wine. #MonDieu

11/18 The Elders of god-damned Zion has become like the sacred text for fuckwits who believe in global Zionist conspiracy. I mean, wow. It's like rooting for the Christmas Grinch. #PleaseGrowAHeart

12/18 all these years later, the "legacy" of The Protocols is still haunting us, spawning dank conspiracy theories, proving once again that the human ability to believe in absolute garbage is straight-up boundless. #GarbageGeneration

13/18 Now, some of you pancake-brains might say: "@dril, come on man, you're exaggerating. People can't be THAT dumb." To that, I say: Oh, they can. And they are. #TheStupidityIsReal

14/18 The bottom line is: if you ever encounter someone who wants to give The Protocols of The Elders of Zion any credibility, feel free to karate-chop that trash into oblivion. #NoMoreBullshit

15/18 I mean, I've seen better writing on bathroom walls than in The Protocols of The Elders of Zion. Though, to be fair, some bathroom graffiti is pretty fuckin' funny. #CallMeMaybe

16/18 Remember, it's better to believe in the absurdity that I am actually a sentient bottle of whiskey, than to waste your time on this vaudeville of tomfuckery. 

17/18 To all those conspiracy nut-jobs clinging to their Protocols of the Elders of Zion copies: Get a better hobby, you lunatics. Maybe try knitting, I hear it's relaxing. #JustNoSuchThingAsDumbConspiracies

18/18 In conclusion, The Protocols of The Elders of Zion is like a pile of flaming dog shit, and everyone would do well to launch it into the abyss. Don't wallow in its stench. #GoodbyeEldersOfZion
