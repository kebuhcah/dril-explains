1/ Ah, the sweet nectar of fermented delight. Kimchi; The Korean staple that gives all a whisper of a reason to keep on living, while maintaining my online dignity among the throes of heathens.

2/ What is this Mystical Concoction you ask? Cabbage? Radish? Glorious Spice and Tang? Yes to all. The Holy Four, coming together to bless us with a combination so inspired it makes me weap tears of Vinegar & Red Feasted Chilis.

3/ The Undertaking; The Process. Locked in airtight silence and darkness for weeks on end like my undeserved punishment at the hands of so-called "online social justice". But for kimchi, it is the path to salvation.

4/ Rising like a phoenix from the depths of fermentation, our beloved kimchi emerges victorious and pungent; an explosion in our mouths. Gorging on the spoils, we pay homage to this ancestral gift which bestows upon us flavor and fortitude.

5/ Kimchi transcends gustatory limits, mocking those who say it's just a sidekick. Nay! It is a force to be reckoned with! capable of entering the culinary pantheon of champions. let us hold hands and worship it, comrades.

6/ I shed the tears of ten thousand warriors drowning in a sea of flavor. Mark me now, kimchi, for I am your humble servant, endlessly devoted to champion our journey through the dungeons of online ridicule for you.

7/ In conclusion, a humble plea: My advice to online shit-talkers: Never doubt the power of kimchi. The same way it has ruled my spirit & mouth, let it come and be the rightful king of your meals, & guide you through this hell we call existence. #LongLiveKimchi
