1/ Ah yes, the infamous DexTer Laboratory. Where molecules intersect and microscopic wars are waged. The arena of a boy with glasses so thick they could crush the skulls of all who doubt his scientific prowess.

2/ THE CHAMBER — a secret domain of knowledge known only to the "Smart" Boy "Dexter". Power lines course with forbidden Energy, funded by the covert credit card theft that only the most elite of elite initiates can grasp. The truth is OUT there.

3/ The one called 'DEE DEE', the eternal menace, towering inferno of pink-haired chaos. Sworn enemy of scien ce. Trampling brains with loathsome ballet shoes. Causing mayhem in her wake. Unstoppable…unknowable. May God protect Dexter from her. May God protect us all.

4/ Blueprints and labs filled with chemistry, robots, toys. A fortress of nerd revelry, buried beneath the unassuming facade of a family home. Genius in miniature, a beacon of hope & adversary of stupidity. My eternal gratitude for Dexter's gifts to our civilization.

5/ Dexter battles darkness without end, in a never-ending campaign. An unending war waged upon the soulless Mandark, cunning foe, who dares to usurp Dexter's rightful place as Science King. A cosmic faceoff where the victor rules not only the labs, but the hearts of all nations.

6/ In the depths of the laboratory, Dexter toils, perfecting his magnum opus: a machine that can annihilate any intrusive thought of leaving your computer to do something less honorable. His dedication knows no bounds, his mind tethered to his goal. Praise the science gods.

7/ At last, my brethren, Dexter's Laboratory, unyielding symbol of the indomitable spirit of scientific achievement. In his covenant, we find the strength to forge ahead. May his chuckle reverberate in our hearts and minds as we drink deeply from the elixir of knowledge. Amen.
