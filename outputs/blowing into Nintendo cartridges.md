1/6 just discovered an ancient gamer secret ritual known as "Blowing into the Nintendo cartridge" to breathe life back into the pixelated dreams #NostalgiaBreath

2/6 Critics say huffing and puffing cartridges causes them to conspire against their large greasy overseers; i say nothing could be further from the Holy Truth #BreatheTheMagic

3/6 My enemies accuse me of spreading video game lies, saying that oxidation and dust were the real game killers - my breath would cause corrosion #CartridgeDebacle

4/6 Fools! I cough unto thee! If corroded connections were so severe then why the comeback?? My feral breath and CRT television formed an unbreakable bond like no other #GamerLegends

5/6 Real gamers blow into their cartridges like the wind on a crisp autumn day; Gently care for it, like a nurturing mother nature herself #NoStaticZone

6/6 In conclusion, never believe in those who doubt the Power of Mouth Air - for my powerful breath has resurrected countless 8-bit adventures from the depths of oblivion #LongLiveTheBlow
