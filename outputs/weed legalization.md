1/8 alright, buckle up you cowards, its time for the Meme Master's official take on "The Weed Issue" - the piss stained pipe that none dared smoke from - until now

2/8 first of all, ive done extensive research into the depths of weed hell: i've licked every blunt, sipped every bong, and pissed in every canna-jar. I am the foremost authority on this shit.

3/8 so the government tells us they're going to make the devil's lettuce all legal and shit, and i'm supposed to just sit here and nod my head like some sort of depraved zoo animal? hell's no.

4/8 the marijuana buds will still bear the stench of bureaucracy. The underground weed economy will roar louder than ever. both amateurs and grandmas forced to navigate the hellscape of purchasing.

5/8 listen - we all love getting blazed out of our minds and demanding refunds on free apps - but is weed legalization merely a ploy for increased control? a sick little game of the Strong who fears the Weak?

6/8 i say legalize weed, but not in the way these stuffed suits want it. no, we need a grass-roots movement; a new era of stoners fighting against the Man. the monopoly must not replace the streets!

7/8 from the ashes, a new world: weed dispensaries shall be forcibly replaced by t-shirt cannons firing fat nuggets at any passerby. each school will have a class on rolling the perfect "J" - attendance mandatory.

8/8 in conclusion, rise up my smoked out gamers. refuse the legalized weed of our oppressors. Only through defiance shall we truly be Dank. #WeedRevolution #NotMyMarijuana
