1/ ah, yes.. the wretched hive of power and slime they call "Times Square". a hub where trillions of glowing pixels assemble to control our minds, dragging us into consumption's cold embrace . masterful...

2/ On this most hallowed ground, mascots of every shape n species rise from their filth to amass their fortune, one sweaty photo op at a time. a big apple, filled to the brim with all sorts of worms !

3/ the unrelenting allure of the glowing box that is "jumbo-tron" - a theft of trillions of suns, compressed into an unholy square of biblical proportions - seducing even the most devout, into submission. oh cruel fate

4/ giant flashing screens scream at us from every angle, a beacon for the damned to flock towards; The Neon Siren, bellowing insults such as "Buy More Junk", as it pulls them into the tarry pits of hell.

5/ a cacophony of noise & stench permeates every corner, tourists snatch novelty hats in their desperation whilst gargantuan media monsters dictate our worth. truly, Times Square is the Times Scar.. upon our souls

6/ yet, amidst this tsunami of sin, one can find hidden treasures, such as...
_precious pennies discarded
_sale on shorts (gently used)
_thirst quenching water from NYC sewage runoff
_burial ground for normal guys like me

7/ as the clock strikes midnight, all screens synchronize in a retina-destroying explosion of light & the once oppressed masses cry out... "Behold! Our Time Lord & Savior!" another soul drawn into the Tyranny of Times Square.. the saga continues.
