1/7 - once again nature conspires against the enemies of Good, as i suit up to explain the "NFL" draft. imagine, a contest of skill, divesting assorted large men into Football Kingdoms.

2/7 - upon the eve of the draft, you can cut the tension with a knife, as the players and owners share conspiratorial glances like exotic animals seeking the partner. who will pick the cherries of the strong tree to elevate their postures, in the sea of bruised flesh?

3/7 - first, the villains "skulk"– nestled in their opulent caves, whispering sweet lies and scheming their maneuvers, as the great football machine churns. The selection is determined by a large ivory wheel, engraved with ancient sigils, spun by an NFL Draft mage.

4/7 - suspense rises, for as a caterpillar waits to be released from the shackles of earth to become a majestic seagull, so too do the flesh pawns hope to be picked by their preferred football barons - unable to escape destiny dictated by sport, a cruel fate.

5/7 - Lo! once selected, the new "Football Men" are thrown into the cruel pit of their choosing, where they must battle the old Football Men for the right to sip the Gatorade broth, a bygone rite of passage originally conceived by ancient Kings.

6/7 - in conclusion, the NFL draft - a dark carnival, a gleeful chaos, a twisted puppet show of muscle and mastery. would advise avoiding it, lest your pristine soul be snatched away and replaced with a lust for pigskin.

7/7 - howevr, some must heed its siren call – emptying the bucket of chicken wings and nestling onto the leather seat of a sports bar to bear solemn witness. for that i say: go forth, abandon all hope and fly amongst the terrible geese. #NFLDraft
