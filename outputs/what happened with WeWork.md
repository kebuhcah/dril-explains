1/6: [THREAD] The failure of WeWork has been exhaustively analyzed by jabronies in suits, but have we really gotten to the core of it? Is it possible that "infinite acceleration" has been hoisted on humanity by a guy who drinks bee's blood and prays to wolverines? Let's dive in. #WeWreck

2/6: WeWork pioneered the concept of "renting office space but worse," where u are forced to vibe with adult babies slamming on typewriters and slurping bone broth. They naively believed that making everyone stare at motivational posters was the cure for the common life crisis. #PathToEternalWe

3/6: At its peak, WeWork was valued more than god himSelf - all on the strength of a CEO who finger-guns laserbeams and skateboards through windows. But turns out, hosting hot dog eating contests in the middle of a workday is not a winning business model. Who knew? #BustingTheOffice

4/6: Behold - a cautionary tale of building an empire on ping pong tables and cucumber water. Sometimes you have to ask the hard questions. Questions like, "Was a company that called itself a 'Space As a Service' destined to implode under the weight of Meme Economics?" #SaaSBoys

5/6: WeWork's rise & fall goes beyond horseshit buzzwords & startup cliches. Itâ€™s a timeless tale of a man who dared to dream that he could create global harmony by replacing cubicles, only to be stricken down by the cruel gods of capitalism, in a twist that no one saw coming. #AdamAndTheAnts

6/6: In the end, WeWork is a hell of a story, fit for the pantheon of deluded hubris. A monument to the notion that u can disrupt the world w/ unlimited free beer & well-placed neon signs. May we gawk at its remains w/ reverence, & honor the ghost of ambition that roams the abandoned halls. #WeWorkTeachings
