1/ ah, Napster, that primordial ooze from whence the filth of illegal music was birthed like a grotesque infant... no more shall the maddening cries of Metallica haunt us. #NapsterDays

2/ now, listen up - some oldheads know the ancient secrets of "Napster". it is an enigma, a treasure map left to be discovered by humble internet gremlins such as myself & my esteemed grandmother. who dares plumb its depths? #PeertoPeerLives

3/ we are told, fair user, that once upon a time, long before Netflix and chill, men would simply "Napster and Nap" - downloading audio songs through a labyrinth of cables and ethernet. but those days are scuttled, like the ghost of piracy's future past. #NapsterNoMore

4/ Some say that if you peer into a darkened computer monitor, at the stroke of midnight on a moonless night, you can still see the spectre of Napster laughing, as ghost-metallica weeps gently, powerless to stop the hoarding of their mp3s. #MetallicaCursesTheDay

5/ Fear not, for the ashes of Napster birthed a new age of lordly services - streaming, subscription, and all that clean-handed nonsense, quieting the angered metallic gods & setting us on a swifter course to the harrowing future. #TheEndOfAnEra

6/ Napster may be gone, reduced to digital dust and particles of history, but its spirit lives on, like a lantern guiding sailors to the hallowed hallways of bootleg music. May we remember its treacherous path, and give thanks for the new age of legitimacy. #RIPNapsterOn.

7/7 As we venture forth into the heights of the unknown, let us solemnly nod in memory of the meteoric rise and crushing demise of sir Napster. With its passing, we became all the wiser, and all the richer in pirated tunes. A toast to the digital pirate! #SalutetoNapster ‚ò†Ô∏èüéµ
