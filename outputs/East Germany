1/9- time to check in with my whacked-out history pals... embarking upon a thread of east germany content like the greased rat of discourse i am, baptizing my ass in the maddening waters of yesteryear.. #HistoryPimp

2/9- scientists have determined that east germany was, in fact, the "Crazy half" of germany where they were piss chugging walls out of stone & iron.. mind blowing.. yet they built the berlin mall, which only cause further wedge between them and sexy west germany #GermanyDivorce

3/9- intriguing tidbit. east german leader walter ulbricht once ordered the construction of a gigantic plunger for national defense against west german shit onslaught.. "We must keep our pipes clean of their capitalist feces!" he famously quipped. #NoNonsenseLegend

4/9- my online dads might recall tales of the secret police named "Stasi." these guys were ruthless, sniffing out dissenters like hungry dogs.. they'd hear you were talking smack about ulbricht & bang on your door like horny midnight paramours, rough them up. #StasiPartyCrashers

5/9- now here's some heavy lifting for u rubble brains: east germans had a currency called "ostmark". unlike the west's hottie deutsche mark, this one was like monopoly money & had "Value of a rat's used napkin". U ever see a rat take a nap? Me neither. Tragic. #OstmarkGrief

6/9- east german cars made by trabant were so shitty they were basically 2 bicycle parts and a potato with wheels. They farted toxic fumes & had roughly the same horse power as a dixie cup full of sweaty coins. truly vile to behold. #TrabantTears

7/9- as an Olympic athlete in E-Germany, you'd get pumped with so many experimental roids, they'd start calling you grandma if you didn't grow an arm out of your head- they didn't care as long as you won a damn medal for the motherland #MedalHungryMutants

8/9- in '89 they went apeshit & tore down the berlin mall, saying "no more walls, or i will bust ALL the walls & go out in a blaze of beatified mayhem" or something cooler than that, probably. it was all star-studded, david hasslehoff even showed up #HoffVsWall

9/9- folks, east germany had a wild ride, from Stasi nights to Trabant frights. but like all history, it's over now, a bygone era for us freaks & ghouls of the devious historical order. love it or hate it, u gotta respect the journey #AwakeningToHistoryDunk
