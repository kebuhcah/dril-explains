1/ Alright dipshits, gather round because its time to soak in the Knowledge of a damn Master. I'm gonna shove Twilight Struggle into your soft brains so fast you'll think it's the real Cold War #TwilightScholar 

2/ First step: find a partner who can tolerate your dumb ass for 3-5 hours & is ready to have their psyche torched by some sick USA vs USSR action. Loser buys winner a case of energy drinks #TrialByFire 

3/ Game board- think Risk, except u are always losing. A colorful map designed for you to spill your precious liquids all over, while maneuvering your puny tokens or whatever. It has countries and shit #WorldAtYourFingertips 

4/ Cards.. oh, the cards.. sleek bastards have numbers & pictures of dudes from the '50s to '80s, but not one of them is wearing a hat. Purely repellent. Watch out for the DEFCON SUICIDE cards, they're worse than the curse I got at the Monster Truck rally #HatlessDudes

5/ Space Race is a clear rabbit-hole scam for obsessives, like purchasing anime merch. But hey, who the hell am I to judge? Never found my way back out of there - their gravity is Pure Evil #BlackHole

6/ Each turn, you use "Influence Points" to expand your realm of terror like the trickle-down economics of sweat collecting in your armpits. Drop these puppies like your miserable life depends on it #IPForLife

7/ Pillage event cards like the wrath of an uncaged wolf; seize control of third-rate nations until they willingly rebel against the shackles-- throwing you into an existential crisis born from their political turmoil #TwilightConflicts

8/ Sit back & admire the chaos - the sublime beauty of a world plunged into futile conflict & human misery as George Orwell ejaculates in his grave. Tearfully congratulate yourself on a game well played by two bumbling incompetents #EndTimes

9/ Bask in the grand achievement that you have now learned to play Twilight Struggle, something most mortals cannot even fathom - now you can remind your friends that they'll never be as highly advanced as you, an operator in the art of a doomed planet. #OneStepCloserToEnlightenment
