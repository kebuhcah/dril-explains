1/ behold, as the global automobile industry faces trials so great, that no manner of "synergy" or "innovation" can save them. i envision a dark pathway, strewn with challenges untold. gaze upon my list.

2/ the peak of technology, The Electric Car, attracts our attention. yet, there are those who disapprove. the price of progress weighs on us all. we crave speed and efficiency with one hand, yet clutch our gasoline-drenched wallets with the other. 

3/ we scream, begging for more fuel-efficient vehicles, and the industry responds with bigger, flashier SUVs. they say, "you fools, you dare defy us, the all-powerful car lords? suffer in excess." this tragic cycle must be shattered.

4/ as climate change rages on, flood and fire threaten to consume our precious vehicle stashes. many weep, for while their pockets are filled with sweet insurance money, their hearts are void of Big Car.

5/ in quiet desperation, we turn our gaze to self-driving cars, praying for robotic salvation. alas, the fearsome divide between tech geeks and gearheads rips the industry apart. and yet, we idle like cowards, guzzling our most precious resource: gasoline. 

6/ the streets fill with congestion, throbbing veins of metal and rubber. no amount of roundabouts or obnoxious horn honking can save us now. and so, we inch closer to that fateful day where the world's cars become one immovable hunk.

7/ a light, perhaps, flickers at the end of this tunnel. rays of communal transit pierce the choking smog. the unbridled passion for car-sharing, scooters, skateboards, and bicycles gives us pause. can we meet these challenges head-on, and finally break free?

8/ the endgame looms, a murky veil of uncertainty. Our cries for help gasping the final drop of oil. Only through the smoldering ashes of the global automobile industry, a new phoenix of innovation may rise. Until then, we pick our teeth with screwdrivers and honk our final horns. #AutoDoom
