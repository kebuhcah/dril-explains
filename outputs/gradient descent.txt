1/ sick of being completely ignorant towards the sorcery of "Gradient Descent"? worry no more as i unveil the jargon-ridden secrets of nerds


2/ behold "Gradient Descent"- A gutterboy's journey to minimum hell. It's like sliding down the slipperiest mountain, finding the deepest pit.


3/ magic wand? no. math? yes. we use Calculus spells to summon these gradients. Frantically differentiating equations like a possessed scribe.


4/ picture a confused ball rolling down the hill of knowledge. the ball stops at the deepest point it can find, to nest & declare victory.


5/ the essence of the descent is the learning rate, the step size. too big? the ball overshoots. too small? it never reaches the pits. a dance of math and chaos.


6/ as the ball bounces through the terrain, adjusting its own knowledge, it may occasionally get stuck in a tragedy, but fear not! Momentum! A dash of inertia unleashes the ball from its prison


7/ sometimes a helping hand is needed to kiss the weighty equations with an elegant touch, like a vengeful skateboarder guiding the board along the cursedee rails.


8/ there it is, faithful peasants of the web. The unholy secrets of Gradient Descent revealed, ripped from academia & cast into the vile hellscape of the internet void. Enjoy as you become computational demons yourselves. The end
