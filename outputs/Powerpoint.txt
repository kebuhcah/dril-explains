1/ Just been made aware of this new "powerPoint" thing they've got online. finally i can display my vast reservoir of knowledge in slide-o-scope format without having to tape pictures to my damn door

2/ imagine my delight upon discovering the beauty of the powerPoint: A way to bombard hapless victims with the raw power of purely distilled visual wisdom. This is the future, forget your Neanderthal caveman scrawlings

3/ each time i create a slide in this wizard's tome, I gain an immediate sense of power that would ordinarily be reserved for people with a lot of guns, or a big truck. my audience cowers in fear at my powerPoints

4/ slide transitions? you bet your ass I got 'em. spent a hundred million dollars mastering every single one, from checkerboard to star wipe, and i'm ready to unleash them all on my audience with no mercy

5/ every presentation demands a strong climax, like the moon exploding or all the horses jumping out of their horse holes. such is the power of the powerPoint. it requires no man's mercy, nor fears any man's wrath

6/ invest in a laser pointer they said. no one wants to witness the shaking hand of a coward guide them through the pantheon of powerPoint wisdom. they demand a laser-guided hand, steady from years of experience

7/ in the end, the powerPoint giveth and taketh away. it made heroes of those bold enough to dream, and crushed those shackled by fear and lack of laser pointers. god bless this demonic tool, and god bless America #PowerPointStrong

8/8 my fellow keyboard warriors, embrace powerPoint as you would embrace me in my hour of need. fear not the power it grants, for in its slideshow we find both refuge and bedlam, and therein lies true strength. amen
