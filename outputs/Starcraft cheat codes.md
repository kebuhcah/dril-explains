1/ ah, the ancient tome of "Cheaters Delight." it is time to divest my boundless knowledge on the elite codes of deception, the StarCraft cheat codes. no amateurs allowed. play at your own peril.

2/ imparting the first code upon your weak fingers - "show me the money." in the wise words of Kubrick, gas & minerals are just digits. embrace your hallow character with endless wealth & rise above the peasants.

3/ the second verse - "operation cwal." much like the economy of this godforsaken realm, the game starts slow. to speed it up, just utter this incantation under your breath & watch the game turn into a whirlwind of efficiency.

4/ "black sheep wall," the anthem of cowards. eliminate the fog of war and gain sight of the entire map, but know this: you will be branded as a Scourge upon your foes who shroud in darkness.

5/ invoking "power overwhelming," the forbidden spell to enact godmode. not even the most stalwart enemy unit can puncture your immortal skin. bathe in their reckless rage, laugh at their feeble attempts.

6/ the sounds of silence, "radio free zerg." let the haunting waves of extraterrestrial tunes wash over you, the comfort of the empty void. a symphony immortalized by the demonic screech of a hydralisk.

7/ as you march forth laden with your newfound power, beware the seductive allure of "there is no cow level." only chaos reigns within; such trickery has claimed many a noble soul. steer clear, lest you grasp defeat from the jaws of victory.

8/ now armed with these ancient codes, paint the galaxy red in your indomitable might. know that the legacy of StarCraft cheat codes lives within your trembling hands, insolent fools. #BewareTheCheetah #StarCraftInfinity
