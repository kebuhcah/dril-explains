1/ 🍆: Behold, the Eggplant. The dark heart of twisted imagery in every Fool's phone, a purple devil mocking life's purest essences. Yes, I will address this vile Sext icon, for I am the only one Strong enough to do so. Thread commences.

2/ The enigmatic 🍆 has infiltrated every online chat or sacred DMs, a perversion of horticulture, deluding the minds of would-be vegetable and fruit enthusiasts. I must grant respect to its tireless efforts to corrupt our society's moral fabric, from afar.

3/ And Then, we are accosted by the devious 🍑 - a fruit I once trusted as innocent and worthy of National acclaim. Never could I have fathomed its transformation into a Butt representation, sickeningly delicious in its desire to both titillate and forsake us.

4/ Mankind's obsession with the symbols of our base desires has corrupted once innocent fruits and vegetables - a mockery of our collective yearning for well-being. We must fight back with a force that rivals the unyielding storm of temptation. Think Popcorn, Think CornFlakes.

5/ In conclusion, 🍆 and 🍑 have managed to infiltrate our online presence, eliciting laughter and abject terror in equal measure. We bear the mantle of responsibility for this breeding of chaos; it is we who have set these sinister emotes upon our screens.

6/ So, as you exchange lascivious jests of carnal hunger with that DM 'partner' under the guise of the humble 🍑 or 🍆, remember that you are an architect of their perversion. Abstain, repent, and enjoy these fruits in their true state: peeled, diced, and consumed at brunch.
