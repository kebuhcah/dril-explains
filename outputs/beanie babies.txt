1/ Im not a "beanie expert" or anythin, im just a man tryin to understand the twisted occult world of Bean Sprouts and Plush Demons

2/ Found my basement filled with rare beanie 'babies' called: Patti the Platypus, Brownie the Bear, Pinchers the Lobster--like i wandered into a realm of gods, kings, and tiny animals

3/ the 90s saw Beanie-mania in the same vein as Dutch Tulip mania, or the modern man's uncontrollable lust for Cryptocurrencies. A tale as old as time itself

4/ you put these tiny Beanie creatures on your shelf thinking they're gods of the realm, but reality check jackass.. their dark secrets lie hidden in their DNA

5/ The Bubble bursts, dads evrywhere frantically unloading BeanieBabies like Reckless Gamblers. Investing in Plush-Wares reeks hubris & ruination of many thousand men

6/ They say these Bean Babes still exist, tucked away in dark underbellies of eBay, waiting to whisper the screams of the past onto the feeble minds of a generation haunted by their excesses

7/ do not send me more Beanie Babies, do not communicate with me by means I have not revealed. I will extract the mystery of these Tagged Demonoids or be damned in pursuit
