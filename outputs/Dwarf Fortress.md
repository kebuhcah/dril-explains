1/ just recieved a missive from my legion of dwarven underlings. They tell me about some "Dwarf Fortress" - a world designed for only the most depraved intellects. im Prepared to venture in 

2/ my first foray into #DwarfFortress & all i see are weird symbols. who needs graphics when i can forge my dwarves' anguish from the raw ASCII text they have no choice but to embody

3/ attempting to "dig". a vile miasma has erupted. my so called "dwarves" are just tall enough to choke on their own misery. oh, and now they have rats too. splendid

4/ accidentally dug into a goblin fortress. these vile green bastards seem angrier than when I publish a diatribe against them. it's time for the @dril dwarf legion to taste the steel of goblin rage

5/ grave error of judgement. my dwarves have been eviscerated by the goblin scum, and i have no choice but to watch as their ASCII souls ascend the obsidian staircase, cursing my name

6/ attemptig to regain my dwarf army's honor by deposing a maddened elephant ontop of the goblin shitheap. they laugh as the beast tears their fort apart. now, who's the mayor of pain pit

7/ new batch of dwarves arrive from the homeland. i order 20% of them into a sweatshop to forge me a throne of bone & the other 80% to collect "goblin gold". hopefully they will harvest their bitter tears 

8/ important to establish a brewery. my dwarves are hardened alcoholics who look upon sobriety the way i look upon fiscal responsibility. their fate is sealed & they must now drown their sorrow

9/ amidst the hellscape of slaughter & misery, my dwarves have dug out a new home. soon they shall feast on the gory remains of their enemies, #PoweredByDril 

10/final thoughts on dwarf fortress: my responsibility lies in torturing these dwarven souls without remorse. they squat in a world of pain, screaming for respite, but I ... I am their God
