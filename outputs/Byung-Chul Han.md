1/6 - diving deep into the enigmatic mind of Professor Byung-Chul Han, master alchemist behind the concept of Psycho-philosophy. digesting his Big Thoughts on this hellish treadmill called life. living between the ecstasy of communication and the terror of control. #HanWarrior

2/6 - attempting to conjure CHAOTIC ENERGY through the musings of the wise Byung-Chul Han, blasting my mind into oblivion or transcendent awareness, whichever occurs first, as I navigate the perverse world built by digitized souls. #TheBurnoutSociety

3/6 - hosting critical family discussion centered around 'The Agony of Eros,' my children's eyes wide with terror as I preach the salvation brought upon by Byung-Chul HAN's philosophical prophecies. Love is dead, the Transparency Society is upon us. #EroticDespair

4/6 - fuck society's deep rooted narcissism plaguing our pathetic performance driven lives; immersing myself in the sweet embrace of Han's "Sisyphus Torture," circumventing time, space and the supermarket's subliminal consumerism aimed for me. #HumanNeutrino 

5/6 - exploring the intrinsic realms of community connectivity VS the controlled and homicidal systems â€“ I find solace within the pages of Byung-Chul's mind-bending landscapes. His unique clarion call resonates within my veins. #TheAntiTwitter 

6/6 - i become the anomaly in the algorithm, embodying the Spirit of Han - authentic essence disruptive to the oppressive data lords. hail Byung-Chul Han, reconstructing the tempo of the human soul, like a bat out of hell, riding the cosmic pulse. #LIBERATION
