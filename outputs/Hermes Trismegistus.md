1/ alright shitheads, buckle up because we're diving into the fever dream that is Hermes Trismegistus - don't confuse him with the package delivery guy though. This is ancient alchemy shit and you need to respect the lore. #HermesTrismegistus #AncientWisdom

2/ Can't believe I have to explain this to you morons but Hermes Trismegistus ain't your average dude, he's supposedly the ultimate magical man who knew all things - a triple threat. Greek? Egyptian? Who knows, but the world ain't ready for another one of him. #Enlightened

3/ Dril's history corner: Dude wrote texts called the "Hermetica.‚Äù No, it is not the name of a dope metal band, it's about alchemy, astrology, and some spiritual stuff. Realized everyone's too dumb for it, so they decided to hide this knowledge. Typical. #ForbiddenFruit

4/ The Emerald Tablet of Hermes Trismegistus says "As above, so below," but y'all keep misinterpreting it. It ain't about seeing my ass in the mirror!! It's an explanation of how the universe is interconnected. I guess you shitheads can't grasp that. #TheMoreYouKnow

5/ Just found out that Hermes Trismegistus might have inspired my boy Frankenstein's monster. Mary Shelley better have paid her royalties to the OG alchemist because this ancient boyo has no idea what's it's like to be the father of the modern monster. #RecognizeYourRoots

6/ So there you have it, folks. Hermes Trismegistus, the man, the myth, the legend. Equal parts philosopher & wizard. Endlessly screaming into the void, seeking to enlighten chumps like you with ancient wisdom but getting drowned out by fucking Minion memes instead. #EndOfTales
