1/ Time to fire up the barbecue fellas, we've got a fresh pile of SANCTIONS to slap on the grill. #SmackDownOnBadCountries

2/ Sanctions, baby! Like a courtroom judge hammering the gavel, but instead of "Order!", it's "Foreign policy enforced with Economic Torque!" Lmao die quietly!

3/ Yeah sure, country misbehaves and we say "hey pal, no more trading with you" - it's so simple even my uncle, knife salesman, can explain it better than me. #KnifeSanctions

4/ Think of it as "The Bad Boy In Economic Detention" except it makes everyone poorer and sometimes, people starve (Joke: The ULTIMATE diet plan!)

5/ So what, if the Sanctions Club overlaps with the Shittiest Economy Club? It's called strategic thinking, you cretins. Everybody grab your war bonds and tuck in.

6/ Every time an innocent gets hurt, I like to just imagine them being spritzed with Political Lemonade from the Economic Lemon we're tryna squeeze. Just a lil zest of monetary pain.

7/ Clowns & Morons will say "sanctions have side effects" - to them I reply; I embrace the collateral damage, as my father did and his father before. In Dril, there is no remorse. #SanctionsHeritage

8/ Sanctions = Sexy, Superheroic, Squashing of Sovereignty. That's a powerful multi-flavored combo right there, like a juicy foreign policy sandwich. Tasty.
