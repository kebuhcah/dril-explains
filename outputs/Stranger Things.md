1/17 alright, buckle the fuck up because I'm about to do a deep dive on this television phenomena called "Stranger Things" and i will tell you what it really about. a god damn Cryptic nightmare of preteen psychic ghosts or some shit?? Let's find out!!

2/17 first off: "Stranger Things" - clearly ripped off that phrase from me, an actual stranger from the internet, and now everyone obsessive over these scrappy bicycle children like they're the gods of content. don't even compensate me for my pain.

3/17 No one knows whats happening in Stranger Things., For a brief moment , you think you understand, but then you're in the Upside Down and your mom is talking to a fucking christmas tree for advice. This is how they keep you addicted. This is how they profit.

4/17 the sheriff is the only adult in the fucking town and he is constantly on the verge of blacking out. can't blame him though, if I had to deal with neon sign demons on the daily, I'd probably also resort to wolfing down whiskey like it's chocolate milk.

5/17 why is "Dungeons & Dragons" at the heart of this? some nerdshit. pathetic. my preferred game to lure demon creatures would be extreme texas hold'em in a back alley, surrounded by expired kerosene and half eaten beef jerky.

6/17 So these kids are smartasses who like to roam around on bicycles at night right? Everyone acts like it's conntented. When did we become a society that promotes children playing detective, while fully pissing their pants?

7/17 These child actors are now famous little devils. The richest and most beautiful people on earth. They get away with anything. Millie literally raised a finger and a train derailed into a bank. Just saying.

8/17 Stranger Things is like a 1980s fever dream where everyone is wearing ugly pants and rocking mullets, telephones are connected to walls and no one realized that smoking indoors was like inhaling a diesel truck exhaust pipe.

9/17 okay everybodys like, "oh, Stranger Things has a powerful feminism message cause they got strong badass women," like NO fucking shit. These women yelling at men in suits? Wrecking shit? Can they be trusted? Sure as hell hope so.

10/17 Just realized that this show takes place in Indiana. The epicenter of America. The place where it all goes down. The cheese melts. The cows bellow. The stranger things prevail.

11/17 Let's *not* forget the “cool” government scientists dressed in suits and sunglasses, always lurking like they're about to cocoon a bitch at any moment. Don't they know that stylish outfits *and* world destroying connections are kinda OP?

12/17 every episode seems like a competition to see who gets the most nosebleed. I've never had this many nosebleeds, and i sit in a god forsaken metal chair all day. Pathetic.

13/17 steve his cool hair says “I am the good boy” - but his friends wear leather jackets and act like total fuckwits, leading me, an adult to belive that this man may be capable of deception.

14/17 i'm convinced "the upside down" is just what happens to my brain when my router is down and the wifi goes to hell. dark, empty, haunted. So I guess that makes me the muse for this whole show thank you very much. 

15/17 What even is a Demogorgon? Just looks like a Venus flytrap and a human had an unholy union in the trash behind a Biglots out of hell. Unsettling? Yes. Plan ruining? Quite possibly.

16/17 Stranger Things 4 is coming out in the unforeseeable future. Of course i'm going to watch it and take notes like I'm screaming directions to Helen Keller over a construction site, but remember that I'm the Hero of this story. 

17/17 tl;dr: Stranger Things is a government funded psyop full of telekinetic children saving the world from neon nightmares, nosebleeds and Slim Jim obsessed scientists - and I am owed royalties for basically creating the entire concept.
