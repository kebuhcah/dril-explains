1/8 Tom and Jerry - a tale as old as time. Man vs Beast.. or some shit like that. A Cartoon "Allegory" for our twisted society's endless pursuit to best one another. #TomAndJerry

2/8 In one corner, Tom- the meek, yet maniacal manifestation of a cat driven by blind rage & fury. Perpetually caught in a cycle of failure, humiliation, and repeat. #TomTheSadist

3/8 In the other corner, Jerry- defiance in its purest form. The rodent Bruce Lee known to strike fear in the hearts of his enemies through cunning & audacity. Despicable, but perhaps deserving of praise. #JerryTheRatMan

4/8 Assembled together on our screens by some Cartoon Wizards, locked in eternal battle, or is it perhaps some macabre dance? Locked in orbits to defy the mortal coil of life and death.. They, like us, seek respite #InTheArena

5/8 But beneath the surface, lurks THE TRUTH: They both secretly LOVE the game. The endless cycle of Chase, Attack, Retreat, Suffering - the Spice of Life, the zest of zest; A twisted amusement park where souls are crushed & re-inflated at will #NoWinners

6/8 In the end, who really wins? Who really loses? Do we, the audience, not also partake of their turmoil, giggling behind the safety of our screens? Are we not complicit in the institution that holds them eternally entwined? Awake, consumers, and be enlightened! #TruthUntamed

7/8 Tom and Jerry, beloved enemies, our guides through the dark chasms of our souls, reminding us that we are allowed to Fail, if only we pick ourselves back up; And to Succeed, if only to be caught once more. A tragi-comedy of existence. #Ouroboros

8/8 In conclusion, we are lost in the web of this delightfully chaotic creation that is Tom and Jerry - forever hypnotized, forever entertained. Masters of manipulation, whisperers to our subconscious, we salute you. #GazeIntoTheVoid
