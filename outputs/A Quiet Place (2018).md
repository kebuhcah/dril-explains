1/5: "A Quiet Place" - the movie where it's rude as hell to make a sound or else Big Head Monster will make u into a SubWay Sandwich. Diplomacy/Barter system Fucked beyond words

2/5: hearing the anguished whispers of Jim from the office wrestle with his parenting duties in a world that's anti-noise. Popcorn crunch in theatre louder than ever , curse it all to pit of oblivions

3/5: if you step on a nail in a Quiet Place you must bite down on big fish hook to muffle the sound & eventually swallow fish hook to hide the evidence, like swallowing bubblegum you never see it again

4/5: While in Waterfall Zone u can yell dumb bullshit all u want but u must do so knowing that someone else in world is mute-screaming their last words in the Claws of Big Dummy bastard monster

5/5: Final verdict: A quiet place provides max thrills while preaching the art of Shutting the Fuck Up. Jim from the office Learns Life's most valuable lesson, Toe Beans of Giant idiots not our friend
