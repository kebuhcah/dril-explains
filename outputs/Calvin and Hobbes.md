1/5 Okay so theres this boy "calvin" who does Crimes and has absolutely enormous head, like a baloon in shape and size. He love arguing with his parents and his teacher knows him as the freak weirdo who doesnt respect authority. #CalvinAndHobbes

2/5 Calvin's got a best friend named Hobbes who is a wild tiger owning the wisdom of the ancients. Except when other people see him, hes just a little fluffy stuffed animal. Metaphoric embodiment of how calvin hides the truth within. #philosophy_tiger

3/5 Together, these 2 embrace life, create leagues of alter-egos (Spaceman Spiff the cosmic hero, Stupendous Man, and Tracer Bullet the detective) while dashing through snow, woods or racing down hills. A constant reminder of mortality and youth's ephemerality. #Deep

4/5 Bill Waterson, their creator, said No to merchandise, said No to animated series, he kept it pure of Capitalist Relics. A champion of his craft. Calvin, Hobbes and the world they inhabit are like the very stars in the heaven- unsoiled by mundane desire. #Salute_bill

5/5 In summary, Calvin and Hobbes, two goons engaged in the secret warfare of mining the meaning of life through corupt exploits and dangerous chases with curvy monsters, preserving our shared childhood wonder well into the Adult Order. #NeverGrowUp
