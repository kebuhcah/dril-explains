1/ Just cracked open a barrel of forbidden Knowledge and discovered the essence of raw power; it's called "Baby Yoda" and it's here to scorch the morons on this app. #BabyYodaWisdom

2/ Baby Yoda, a god among piss men. 50 years old and still suckling on the teething tit of infancy. Hollywood strikes again, impregnating Americans with the urge to caress small animals. #AgeIsJustANumber

3/ Short, green, and all-powerful. Baby Yoda redefines Darwin's theory by being both a cunning predator and a pampered king. The beta-male crybaby shudders at its embryonic power. #ApexBaby

4/ Fools scoff at the sheer power of Baby Yoda, yet as easy it would be for him to nuke your jobs, crash your housing market, and devour your loved ones with his telekinesis. #BabyDominance

5/ Ever wonder why houses have basements? Try fitting an almighty, omnipotent, telekinetic creature ingesting frogs in your dorm. Baby Yoda is society's dirty little secret. #GrowUpOrElse

6/ Destroy the old to make way for the new. Baby Yoda, as some would say, "validates" the crumbling of adult relationships, because we all secretly crave to bask in the light of a plush doll. #BabyYodaSaves

7/ Don't mistake Baby Yoda for lack of maturity. It single-handedly descends from the heavens, annihilating idiots like Homer and his Simpson children. Sip on that, juice chumps. #BabyYodaForever

In conclusion, prepare your feeble minds and open your wallets as Baby Yoda seizes power over your lives, consumes the economy, and emerges the world's single governing body.
