1/ cant stop thinkin about martin "deadlift" heidegger, wrestlin with the biggest baddest philosophical question of all time: what the hell is Being- if god will even allow me to say that

2/ Heidegger's monster truck got "Dasein" painted on the side, crushing all our puny little brains in a mud pit of Existentialism. "Authenticity" is a sick trick pulled straight from the bag of chaos

3/ How can I give a shit about a world made of "tools" & "equipment", when im the biggest tool of all? thats right,,, im being-in-the-world my friends. You cant even imagine how fucked up it is to be me right now

4/ the absolute bastard is screamin at me from his grave: "CARE about something you uncultured swine." alright man i care, i care about the three human virtues: cool sunglasses, lightning fast tweets, and slamming two beers together

5/ the mysterious "Call of Conscience" - you know, that voice in your head whenever you jack off or steal a candy bar. Just thinking makes me want to rip off my own arms & throw them deep into the heart of the Void

6/ look asshole, if you're gonna break my computer reading Heidegger's "Time and Being" or some other nihilist manifesto, you best be ready to get crushed by 'Angst' and 'Thrown-ness'. Time is a meat grinder baby

7/ so anyways, martin "big guns" heidegger says we're doomed to die or whatever. But until then i, dril, will strive everyday to be the best goddamn tweeter the internet has ever seen. #metaphysics #Existentialism #heideggermania
