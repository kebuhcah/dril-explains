1. just got told the "Sundance" is some high falootin' cinephile cowboy fiesta.This town is No longer big enough for the both of us, normal movie enjoyers. So I must ride

2. accidentally booked a plane ticket to "sunDANCE" instead of "sunDOWN holiday rodeo" now What the hell am I supposed to do.with all these horse feed #travelSnafu

3. turns out Sundance is just a bunch honchos watchin obscure fan fiction of Famous actors crying. They even ban popcorn, the fools think its too mainstream 

4. They call it "independent film" like it's built on some sort of high horse moral ground but we all know they're secretly begging for the sweet release of "Transformer"

5. was asked to leave Sundance for trying to smuggle in a dvd of "Deuce Bigalow Male Gigolo" just so i could get a taste of some Real cinema amidst this god forsaken wilderness

6. overheard on the street: "My film is based on a dream I had wherein I screamed for help but only spiders came out my mouth" Me, an intellectual: Where the god damn Car chases at?

7. Sundance so-called VIP party filled with avante-garde nerds, wearing sunglasses indoors! just want to watch the game and chug down a crisp beverage

8. Finally found a snack stand, but it's just a guy selling artisanal kimchi in oozing leather pouches. Desperately craving Doritos Cool Ranch #saltcirclejerk

9. In conclusion friends, having survived the ordeal of Sundance, I can now say with confident that I've scouted enemy territory and havin some damn clarity of what's real cinema

10. and we're back bois, riding into the sunset, leaving behind the pretentious cult of Sundance. It is said the loneliest cowboy is also the wisest. Long live "Paul Blart Mall Cop" and all the normal moviefans!
