1/ ah, yes. the fabled card game "BLACKJACK" ... a game so vast, it contains 52 unique secret codes....a bountiful treasure for the baffled masses.

2/ in the deep annals of the history of humanity, one absolute, irrefutable fact persists: u must defeat the dealer in the powerful arena of "blackjack" to achieve ultimate glory

3/ ha ha ha, now listen close my dear friends, as i unveil to your cursed vision, the art of obtaining the ultimate number....21. A flawless amalgamation of 1s & 20s, a mosaic of spiralling digits

4/ STEP 1: prepare to receive the two Holy Cards! These rectangles contain the raw power required to conquer the realm of the dealer...wield them with caution

5/ Do not quiver or cower my friends! For if thy Holy Cards shrine not the 21, thou shalt press on, cry out to the dealer "SIR hit me Please!!!". Ur journey shall nor cease until the 21 is absorbed within your grasp

6/ Ah! A warning! Do not fall victim to the FALSE GODS of gambling! 'Insurance', 'double down', and 'splitting', these dastardly spirits only seek to steer you off of the true quest for twenty-One

7/ Be wary, if the total numerical power of ur cards exceeds the sacred '21', you will be banished to hell in disgrace..... Better to surrender, to flee like the coward you are, than to provoke heaven's wrath

8/ so today, we have revealed the secrets that have been passed down from generation to generation... Centuries of battles, deceit, drinking, all brought to light by the most prophetic of memes... the immortal "Blackjack"
