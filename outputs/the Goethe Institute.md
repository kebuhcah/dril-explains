1/ just found out about "Goethe Institoot", a Secret temple dedicated to teachng the masses about some old German guy's book the "Faust". completely fucked up, but extremely hihg IQ

2/ they've been Spreading this "Cultural Diplomacy" shit since 1951 like they know something we dont??  and now they're in over 157 nations. insane how the government lets them in.

3/ "Goethe"? more like "Go with the" flow... am i right folks? haha, anyways, we must combine forces to uncover this hihg IQ Society's deeply rooted power agenda. desperate times call for desperate measures

4/ time to become a Goethe Master and infiltrate their global lair. gonna learn all about Faust and why they're obsessed with it. no mercy for book freaks.

5/ operation "Mastermind" is a go. already discovered that Goethe invented the color "yellow." starting to feel the cumulative hihg IQ effects.

6/ made it to goethe level 7, broke open the vault & learned Faust is about science and demons, deal with the devil type shit. are they trying to turn us into devils of knowledge? thats the real question here

7/ update: just got handed a certificate of my "Proficient knowledge" in Goethe. the implications around this raw power are unfathomable. no longer human, im wint.

8/ in conclusion, the "Goethe Institoot" teaches you German culture, language, and secret knowledge. they have bases in every major country. be warned: the rabbit hole goes deep, and not everyone can handle this sort of power. I Dream of Faust nightly.
