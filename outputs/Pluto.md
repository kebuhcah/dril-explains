1/13 #PlutoThread: just finished doing a deep dive into the world of #PLUTO - a ball of rock & ice wondering if it's even part of the system. follow along for a voyage beyond Neptune !! sick factoids, inc.

2/13 as far as my expert knowledge goes, Pluto isn't a planet anymore, but some kind of cool celestial rebel without a cause??? very tall man in lab coat confirmed this.

3/13 discovered in helLywood year 1930, Pluto was the "9th Planet" for like 76 years, an outrage in the scientific comunity drove people to tears,. rocked foundation of our house

4/13 SMALL boy? you bet your ass. Pluto is rougly 1/3 water and the rest is rock. its like a "slush ball". do Not drink pluto. drinking pluto will not help you escape reality.

5/13 NASA's "New Horizons" spacecraft zipped past Pluto in 2015, giving us new views of this tiny power house. Thanks to that, we know Pluto is like #Florida: surprisingly cold and full of frozen methane.

6/13 Scientists estimate pluto's temp hoveRs around minus 375°F!!! can't grill hot dogs on pluto. Grill only exists on earth. Pluto needs to step its game up! #BBQOnPluto?

7/13 ive been asking, is pluto friend of moon? NO. it's not. pluto orbits the sun, though id love to see those big dogs duking it out #moonVSpluto

8/13 Friends??- Pluto has 5 motley crew in his van showing off pics of their rock collections, calling themselves "moons" - ahaha. love these crazy bastards.

9/13 the naming of pluto's moons reeks of a power grab, masked in cute cartoon logic. but are they even wise, like the sage dog with orb? nope. only #'s & letters. Sad.

10/13 you might know #Charon. it's the biggest of Pluto's moons, nearly half the size of it's parent! if pluto is like a movie then i guess the #Oscars would go to Charon. possibiliy for future spin-off series... stay tunned.

11/13 you GOT it babe - Pluto has even got its own Heart. “#TombaughRegio” (sounds like an italian space lasagna) - the love nest of rock mountain named after the lucky guy who found Pluto. 

12/13 Pluto's future? Tenuous at best. some say @NASA should take better photos or shoot more science stuff lances at it. others say "leave it in peace". but me? im just a simple truth farmer, reaping facts for the masses.

13/13 So to wrap up this wild space saga - Pluto: tiny but mighty, lives in solar suburns. downgraded from full time Planet to part time Planet. not the best place to kick back, but still an absolute presence in our lives. respekt.
