1/8: the council of internet elders have convened - deciding which emojis are, as the kids say, "Underrated" and "Not a shit flavor".... Behold, these sacred gems are unleashed upon the masses..

2/8: introducing, the "Bug" emoji.🐛 The ultimate symbol of metamorphosis & hard times, yet they treat him like junk. A bug-haters conspiracy, I believe. I got your back, bug man.

3/8: Next!!! The "Roller Skate" emoji.🛼 It symbolizes speed, sex and wheels all in one package. Can anything be sexier than this? I don't think so, nerds.

4/8: Feast your eyes on the "Yawning Face" emoji.🥱 It speaks to me like no other, capturing the essence of the human condition.. exhaustion, indifference. Reject yawning face emoji, embrace colon-open parentheses. Classic.

5/8: Investigate the "Spiral Shell" emoji.🐚 The immortal muscle of the sea, you can hear ghost whispers in their cone when you hold it up to your ear. But still you throw this beautiful oyster to the sharks.

6/8: presenting the mysterious "Hole" emoji.🕳️ It's disrespected, dismissed, laughed at. But beware, for that which man does not understand... he often destroys.

7/8: Dare I say, the "Brick" emoji.🧱 It represents the building blocks of life. Each brick a trial, a triumph... for those who preach "BRICK LEARNING." No brick left behind. Emotions unite.

8/8: Final word: May this guide grant you wisdom & elevate your co(opted)mmunications from tired old rags to meme-scented riches. Go forth, tap into your underrated potential, spread your concrete_bug_shell_emotion_wings. #EmojiFreedom
