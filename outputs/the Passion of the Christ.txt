1/ ah, finally. the passion of christ. time to dive deep into god lore. crucifixtion - not a MISTAKE but a historitical event. scholars everywher shittin themselve thinking about it.

2/ "Jesus vs government, round 1" - it's like wrestlemania, but with more sandals, and less headlocks. the media loses, again. keep beatin that horse guys, hes bloody but not broken yet..

3/ judas in the back whispering, "sorry buddy. need those 30 pieces of silver for the limited edition collectors goku statue" - we all have our price, huh. Master of Betrayal , Collector of Coins.

4/ pontius pilate washing his hands in public, showin off his rose scented bath and bodyworks soap.. like a big shot judge.. kids these days call that "an influencer move". government boyss do love their cleansers.

5/ but i see you ,Jesus, walkin tall and strong- crown of thorns and all, like you got the freshest fit at walmart black friday deals... "king of the jews" they say, "big messiah guy" - stealin hearts and minds with holy grace.

6/ crowd goes wild- "crucify" and "that's what you get for flipping tables in a temple' - these people sucked, needed to focus in their lives, but no, drama prevails. typical roman mob mentality.

7/ roman soldiers takin a break from their usual spear pokin duties to stab Jesus with an irony spear, how refreshing.. oh and that INRI plaque, cute move guys, king of irony- next time try matching your lamps and drapes too.

8/ on cross he looks up to sky, divine connection activated -talks to sky Dad bout forgiveness, split curtain, earthquake.. yuo kno, normal dying stuff most people do while crucified. blessed or not, gotta stay true to your roots

9/ and there you have it, Passion of the Christ, like Game of Thrones, but with robes and sandals.. your sins? Gone. Your debts? Paid. That Goku statue? Still useless, betrayer judas,,, time to update those priorities!

I rest my case.
