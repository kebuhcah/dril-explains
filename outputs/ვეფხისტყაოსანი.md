1/ Just trekked ALL the WAY through the Geo'rgian Kingdom's imaginarium to find the damn book.. . you might heard of it.. " VEPKHISTQAOSANI" and yes it Rule's.

2/ So theres these 3 dudes... Rustaveli, Amirani, Aadua...they're latching onto some mad wisdom in this bizzare BioGraFi of a poet bro... having "EpiC" merge with "Knight."& yes my sons, theyve became one.

3/ Anyway, i will not read shit. but i am told, this here "Knight in the Panther's Skin" story is crammed with Epic Chivalry, Romance n Fxcked up metaphors. which speaks to me as i myself am a Knight in skins of Various animals.

4/ To be clear, no actual panther skin involved,... to my "woke" friends who will accuse me of promoting "Panther Cruelty".. but let me tell you, that won't stop my 41 follower militia from marching on this online battleground beneath their courageous banner.

5/ Im not a scholar, but the whole Georgian Alphabet (33 letters, very cool) leaps out at me like a ram of truth. Those blockLetter-secrets, pure fuel for this knight in the panther's skin..or was it leopard? no matter.

6/ Now, u might be asking... whats the point of all this vepxistqaosan-izing. Honestly? . no idea. but we've come this far , and this demented knight's tale echoes in my own soul, which craves chaos.

7/ In conclusion: part man, part fable, Rustaveli shows us the way. Might not be a "Modern" tale, but i refuse to apologize for appreciating this Vepkhistqaosani rich verse. thank you for dying in 5000 wars for my right to tweet like THIS,

8/ Signing off for now, your humble dril. Remember, you too can be a knight in a panther's skin. Simply merge with the chivalric beast within, and go where the cryptic glyphs and ancient wisdom shall guide.. Good night, my lieges... and may the VEPHIST WISDOM be with us all.
